To meet this de-\\nmand, one candidate mechanism to increase production is to increase housing and manage more birds. However,\\nthis practice, along with labour shortages and increasing biosecurity practices will make it increasingly diﬃcult\\nfor producers to monitor the production, health, and welfare status of all their birds. Employing smart poultry\\nmanagement systems is necessary to increase production while minimizing costs and the use of resources. Smart\\npoultry management systems include precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies such as smart sensors,\\nautomation of farm processes, and data driven decision making platforms. Many new technologies will have\\ngreat implications for poultry production in the areas of the poultry house environment, bird welfare, precision\\nfeeding, and rapid detection of infectious disease. As smart sensors collect data in real-time on a variety of\\nparameters from poultry operations, large amounts of data will be generated. To make best use of this data, big\\ndata analytical tools must be employed to produce data driven decisions. Additionally, the devices that will be\\nincorporated into smart poultry management systems will be connected to the Internet allowing for the for-\\nmation of Internet of things (IoT) farm networks. IoT technologies allow for communication between farm\\nsensors, devices, and equipment, and will lead to the automation of multiple farm procedures. The following\\nreview discusses the areas of impact that new smart sensor technologies will have on poultry operations and\\ndescribes how sensor technology is related to big data analytics and IoT systems, and how these technologies can\\nenhance production in the poultry industry. Additionally, challenges to the described systems and technologies\\nwill also be highlighted and discussed.\\n1. Introduction\\nBy the year 2050, global demand for poultry meat will be over\\ndouble what it was in 2005, and the demand for chicken eggs will be\\nalmost 40% greater (Smith et al., 2015). This increase in demand,\\ncombined with a global increase in competitiveness for agriculture re-\\nlated resources (Godfray et al., 2010) has potential to aﬀect the prof-\\nitability of poultry production systems. Nevertheless, solutions for these\\nchallenges can be attained with changes in farming strategy and im-\\nplementation of new smart management technologies. These include\\nprecision livestock farming (PLF) practices in addition to other tech-\\nnologies related to the collection and use of farm generated data. PLF\\ncan be described as a system of farming that optimizes the care and\\nattention that farmed animals receive by monitoring animals in real-\\ntime, ideally resulting in individual animal monitoring or at the smal-\\nlest unit that can be managed (Berckmans, 2017; Halachmi and\\nGuarino, 2016). Systems of PLF can be initiated in poultry houses where\\nsmart sensors can measure numerous factors related to production in\\nreal-time.\\nMonitoring poultry production with new sensory technologies will\\nlead to the production of large volumes of data that need to be stored\\nand be made readily accessible. In addition, as data are generated and\\nmade accessible, decisions based on the outputs should be made rapidly\\nor in real-time. Therefore, making use of PLF technologies requires\\ncritical data analysis systems to be set in place allowing for consistent\\ndata driven decisions to be made.\\nThis review sets out to highlight areas where new PLF sensor\\ntechnologies can enhance systems of poultry production, including:\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.105291\\nReceived 6 November 2018; Received in revised form 31 December 2019; Accepted 10 February 2020\\n⁎ Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: shayan@uoguelph.ca (S.

Furthermore, systems for storage, access, and analysis of\\nsensor generated data are mentioned, in addition to the subject of data\\ngovernance, which has large implications in future systems of poultry\\nproduction. Finally, big data analytics and internet of things (IoT)\\ntechnologies are reviewed regarding their connection to new sensor\\ntechnologies and data, in addition to the potential beneﬁts they provide\\nfor systems of poultry production.\\n2. Precision livestock farming: Implementing new sensors and\\ntechnologies to enhance poultry production\\nLivestock management systems typically consist of three separate\\nfunctions: sensing and monitoring, analysis and decision making, and\\nintervention (Wolfert et al., 2017). PLF systems facilitate automation of\\nthese processes by decreasing the need for manual observations and\\nhuman decision making, greatly decreasing the time and eﬀort needed\\nto manage large numbers of livestock. PLF systems allow for livestock\\nto be monitored and managed in real-time, and for management to be\\ncarried out on the smallest individual unit, sometimes as a single animal\\napproach (Halachmi et al., 2019). This allows producers to manage\\nlarger numbers of animals, while still ensuring that they provide a level\\nof care similar to what could only be done with fewer animals (Smith\\net al., 2015). Single animal management is not always possible on large\\npoultry operations that contain thousands of birds, however, a pro-\\nportion of birds can be monitored using PLF technologies and these\\ninputs can be applied accordingly to assess ﬂock health (Dallimore,\\n2017). Sensors that measure a variety of diﬀerent parameters facilitate\\nPLF systems for monitoring large numbers of poultry. The following\\nsection focuses on three areas in which sensors and new technologies\\ncan beneﬁt poultry production systems, namely: the poultry house en-\\nvironment, precision feeding systems, and poultry welfare. Barriers to\\nimplementation of the highlighted technologies are also summarized.\\n2.1. Environmental monitoring systems\\nThe environment of the poultry house is an important factor for\\nproduction that can be monitored and optimized. Environmental inputs\\ninclude temperature, air velocity, ventilation rate, litter quality, hu-\\nmidity and gas concentrations, including carbon dioxide and ammonia\\n(Dallimore, 2017). An example of how PLF technologies can be used to\\nmonitor and control the poultry house environment is exempliﬁed by\\nhumidity regulation via ventilation rate changes mediated by relative\\nhumidity sensors, as relative humidity is one of the more important\\nenvironmental aspects of a poultry house (Conley, 2012). Relative hu-\\nmidity levels can impact bird health; additionally, relative humidity\\nlevels are known to be correlated with concentrations of ammonia and\\ncarbon dioxide gas in poultry houses. When levels of these gases in-\\ncrease, a decrease in production and bird health can occur (David et al.,\\n2015). Currently, several technologies for monitoring environmental\\nvariables are commercially available and implemented in poultry pro-\\nduction systems; however, more advanced systems of environmental\\nmonitoring and control are being researched. Multi-sensor systems\\ncapable of tracking temperature, air velocity and diﬀerential pressure in\\nbroiler houses have been shown to eﬀectively assess barn ventilation\\nsystem function (Bustamante et al., 2012). The impact of the poultry\\nhouse environment on production is evident, and implementation of\\nenvironmental sensor technology in poultry houses can aid producers in\\nreaching desired levels of production. For example, a prediction model\\ngenerated by Jackman et al. (2015) used temperature, relative\\nhumidity, carbon dioxide, and ammonia sensor inputs combined with\\nbird weight data in order to predict broiler weight up to 72 h in ad-\\nvance, with the accuracy of the model being described by the authors as\\ngood to excellent. In broiler chicken production, where meeting a target\\nbird weight by a speciﬁc date is important, systems like this would\\nallow for actions to be taken sooner by producers if bird weight is\\nprojected to be low. As more non-invasive surveillance technologies are\\ndeveloped and implemented in poultry houses, including those for\\nhealth, welfare and feeding, there exists potential for more data to be\\nincorporated into predictive production models, potentially enhancing\\ntheir predictive capabilities.\\nSome technical limitations of environmental sensors for poultry\\nproduction exist. For example, in a study where multiple sensor nodes\\nwere used to measure carbon dioxide in a controlled chamber, in-\\ndividual sensors demonstrated linear responses to increasing carbon\\ndioxide concentrations; however, their individual performances dif-\\nfered, leading to diﬀerences in absolute carbon dioxide levels measured\\n(Calvet et al., 2014). Therefore, the researchers highlighted the need for\\nregular sensor calibration. This is especially important even though\\ncarbon dioxide sensors are thought to be more robust compared to\\nammonia or relative humidity sensors. Additionally, traditional place-\\nment of environmental sensors in poultry houses on walls or in an\\nelevated position may not reﬂect the true environmental conditions of\\nthe poultry house airspace. Placement of wireless temperature, relative\\nhumidity, ammonia and carbon dioxide sensors on the poultry house\\nﬂoor elevated to be within the airspace of birds has been tested ex-\\nperimentally (Jackman et al., 2015). Systems of wireless environmental\\nsensors have potential for use in commercial houses, however, Jackman\\net al., (2015) reported that in order to use environmental data for bird\\nweight prediction, individual poultry houses will likely need series of\\nexperiments and optimization to generate a predictive weight model.\\nRobotics are another potential technology that could be used to\\nmonitor and maintain the environment of poultry houses. Robots that\\ncan automate monitoring of the environment of poultry houses are\\ncurrently being developed and produced by a number of commercial\\nmanufacturers (Connolly, 2017). Robots are designed as autonomously\\ndriven small vehicles that operate on the ﬂoor or lightweight devices\\nthat travel on rails above the birds, performing tasks as they navigate\\nthe poultry house. These robots could enhance bird health and activity\\nlevels by inducing bird movement (Epp, 2019). In addition, commer-\\ncially available robots with added devices can aerate the litter on the\\npoultry house ﬂoor. Aerated litter can decrease the incidence of certain\\npoultry diseases and infections; for example, decreased Salmonella in-\\nfection in broilers has been experimentally observed in poultry rooms\\nwith aerated litter (Bodi et al., 2013). Robots that can apply disin-\\nfectants to the litter are also currently being produced for use in poultry\\nhouses (Epp, 2019). Additionally, these newly developed robots can\\ncontain sensors that evaluate the environment of the poultry house in\\nreal-time (McDougal, 2018). Robots like this allow the environment to\\nbe monitored remotely, decreasing the need for human workers to enter\\nthe poultry house, thereby enhancing biosecurity.\\n2.2. Precision feeding systems\\nFeeding on poultry farms is an important aspect of raising poultry\\nand it is an area where PLF technologies can have a major impact on\\nproduction. Whether it is maximum growth, achieving precise feed\\nconversion rates, or maintaining optimal bird weight, new technologies\\ncan optimize poultry feeding. One area where feeding strategies are\\nunder focus is on broiler breeder farms, which are responsible for\\nproducing broiler chicks which have been selectively bred resulting in a\\nphenotype that leads to rapid weight gain and maximum meat pro-\\nduction. Broiler breeders possess these rapid growth genes; however,\\nbreeders do not lay eggs eﬃciently when gaining weight rapidly and\\ntherefore controlling feed consumption is important for management of\\nbroiler breeders. Controlling feed consumption on farms results in large\\nJ. Astill, et al.\\nComputers and Electronics in Agriculture 170 (2020) 105291\\n2'),\n",

Broiler breeder producers must consistently weigh\\nbirds and base feeding on the average weight (Schneider et al., 2004).\\nAlthough possible, this is very tedious, requires constant sampling, and\\nif not done properly, could lead to improper feeding regimes. To this\\nend, an experimental precision feeding system has been developed that\\nregulates the release of feed to individual birds, one at a time, based on\\nthe weight of the bird that is seeking feed (Zuidhof et al., 2017). The\\nmachine lets lighter birds eat while restricting heavier birds from\\nfeeding. Initial trials using this precision feeding technology have de-\\nmonstrated a 50% decrease in body weight variation between broiler\\nbreeder chickens. This style of feeding also allows for numerous feeding\\nperiods per day which has been shown to enhance feed conversion\\ncompared to the standard once daily feeding. Additional work by the\\nsame group has led to a more developed precision feeding system; this\\nsystem can weigh individual birds while simultaneously using radio\\nfrequency identiﬁcation from a wing tag to track their feed intake. The\\nprecision feeding system has since demonstrated more eﬃcient feed\\nconversion (Hadinia et al., 2018) and slightly higher levels of fertility\\n(Zuidhof, 2018) in broiler breeders compared to normal feeding re-\\ngimes. Other types of poultry, such as laying hens, could also beneﬁt\\nfrom sensor technologies that can more precisely assess and control\\nlevels of feed intake (Xin and Liu, 2017). Despite their experimental\\nsuccess, some questions exist surrounding implementation of precision\\nfeeding systems into commercial production, including cost and\\nadaptability of these systems in addition to their ability to work in large\\nﬂocks. Additionally, recent research has demonstrated that although\\nprecision fed broiler breeders produce more fertile eggs, the number of\\neggs that are laid by these birds is fewer then those fed conventionally\\n(Zuidhof, 2018).\\n2.3. Welfare monitoring systems\\nA prominent concern of the poultry industry is maintaining appro-\\npriate bird welfare standards. Some technologies for enhancing poultry\\nwelfare have been reviewed previously (Sassi et al., 2016). The ability\\nto understand the welfare status of large numbers of birds can be made\\nfeasible with the implementation of new technologies. There are many\\nnon-invasive technologies that allow for bird welfare to be assessed;\\nherein four classes of technologies are highlighted for their potential in\\npoultry production systems. They are: digital imaging, vocalization\\nanalysis, infrared thermal imaging, and raman spectroscopy. Following\\na description of the technologies, barriers to their implementation are\\ndescribed.\\n2.3.1. Digital imaging\\nCapturing the movement patterns of broiler chickens in poultry\\nhouses with digital imaging technologies enables measurement of\\nchicken activity, which can be used as an indicator of welfare status.\\nDigital imaging has been used experimentally with poultry species,\\ndemonstrating that this technology can be used to assess many factors\\nrelated to welfare. Examples of these factors include gait score, bird\\nweight, stocking density in relation to feeding patterns and bird re-\\nsponse to diﬀerent environmental conditions (Corkery et al., 2013).\\nLameness is an issue in broiler production due to the physical and\\nphysiological demands placed on these birds. Assessing lameness is\\nrequired for producers and standard methods include diﬀerent manual\\nmonitoring methods (Marchewka et al., 2013), which can be subjective\\nand increase labour and time requirements. Capturing broiler move-\\nment patterns using the eYeNamic™camera surveillance and software\\nsystem, which features overhead cameras in poultry houses, has de-\\nmonstrated the ability to assess gait scores of birds, suggesting it to be a\\npotential eﬃcient solution to assess lameness in broilers (Silvera et al.,\\n2017). Importantly, it provides a continuous and objective alternative\\nsurveillance method compared to manual monitoring methods. How-\\never, the researchers highlighted that the model employed in the\\nexperimental setting would likely have to be modiﬁed for diﬀerent\\ncommercial settings, otherwise gait score accuracy could potentially\\ndecrease. Digital imaging has also been studied as an indicator of in-\\nfection with microorganisms. For example, Colles et al. (2016) analysed\\nthe optical ﬂow patterns of birds infected with Campylobacter, which is\\na technique that assesses diﬀerences in brightness in series of images. It\\nwas found that by using optical ﬂow patterns, infected chickens could\\nbe detected within 7 to 10 days after hatch; this is despite the fact that\\nCampylobacter typically does not induce clinical signs in chickens.\\nCampylobacter is a common cause of foodborne illness in humans,\\ntherefore, rapid detection using optical ﬂow patterns could allow pro-\\nducers to quickly determine the source of Campylobacter infection after\\nit is detected, in addition to allowing for actions to be taken to prevent\\nfurther infection of other birds.\\nA speciﬁc welfare problem that has been addressed with digital\\nimaging techniques is footpad dermatitis, which manifests itself as le-\\nsions on the chicken footpad (Sassi et al., 2016). Current methods for\\nassessment of footpad dermatitis consist of manual monitoring by\\ntrained personnel which is expensive, slow and is limited to inspection\\nof only a small sample of the broiler ﬂock. It has been demonstrated\\nthat images taken of broiler footpads after slaughter while in the\\nslaughter line can be used as an automated system for detection of\\nfootpad dermatitis (Vanderhasselt et al., 2013). The system would be\\nable to detect footpad dermatitis at the processing plant, identifying the\\nneed for changes to occur in the poultry house litter where the birds\\nwere previously housed, reducing footpad dermatitis from occurring in\\nfuture ﬂocks.\\n2.3.2. Vocalization analysis\\nAnother method that is being explored as an indicator of poultry\\nwelfare is vocalisation analysis, which uses the sounds that birds pro-\\nduce as an indicator of health and welfare (Manteuﬀel et al., 2004).\\nBirds can produce a large variety of diﬀerent vocalizations; however,\\nresearch is demonstrating that certain sounds can be used as indicators\\nof bird health and welfare. For example, research has noted higher\\nfrequencies of distress related calls in broiler breeder hens when de-\\nprived of nesting (Manteuﬀel et al., 2004). Additionally, by recording\\nbroilers over a period of 38 days, researchers were able to determine\\nthe peak frequency (Hz) of 600 randomly selected vocalizations, ob-\\nserving that as broilers grew larger, the peak frequency of vocalizations\\ndecreased (Fontana et al., 2015). Other stressors such as feather\\npecking have also been shown to be associated with a higher incidence\\nof squawking and vocalization (Bright, 2008). Detecting infection with\\npathogenic microorganisms is also possible with this technology. The\\nfrequency of rales produced by chickens infected with infectious\\nbronchitis virus has been shown experimentally to be able to detect\\ninfection before clinical signs are evident in infected chickens (Carroll\\net al., 2014; Rizwan et al., 2017). This method would be advantageous\\ncompared to conventional methods employed for disease detection such\\nas visual inspection, as treatment or remedial actions can be initiated\\nmuch sooner to inhibit further bird infection.\\n2.3.3. Infrared thermal imaging\\nInfrared thermal imaging is an imaging technique that can be used\\nto assess poultry welfare with minimum invasiveness. Infrared imaging\\ncan determine the surface temperature of objects and create an image\\nmap with colours representing diﬀerent temperatures (Nääs et al.,\\n2014). Heat stress is detrimental to poultry health and body tempera-\\nture is indicative of physiological abnormalities that can lead to ele-\\nvated rates of mortality. Infrared thermal imaging can be used to detect\\nchicken temperature after changes in diet, poultry house environment\\nand stress levels. Monitoring chickens with infrared technology also has\\npotential to assist with automation of certain farm procedures.

This technology\\nis also able to assist in studying and assessing the temperature of de-\\nveloping chicken embryos. For example, Shinder et al. (2009) used\\ninfrared technology to measure eggshell temperature of developing\\nembryos, allowing for determination of average embryo temperature.\\nThis research showed that exposing incubated eggs to a temperature of\\n15 °C on day 18 or 19 of incubation can enhance the thermoregulatory\\nabilities of hatched chicks while also decreasing the incidence of as-\\ncites. Therefore, infrared thermal imaging can allow producers to ac-\\ncurately determine the temperature of developing embryos which could\\nbe important for future management strategies.\\n2.3.4. Raman spectroscopy\\nA prominent welfare issue in the egg-layer industry is the culling of\\nday-old male layer chicks. Non-contact raman spectroscopy is an ima-\\nging technique that has been demonstrated to be capable of assessing\\nthe sex of chicken embryos. This was done by analyzing the raman\\nspectroscopy proﬁle of circulating embryonic blood from eggs that had\\nonly been incubated for 3.5 days (Galli et al., 2016). This technique of\\nsexing developing embryos does not require any biological samples\\nfrom the egg to be removed for analysis, however, it does require the\\nremoval and replacement of a portion of eggshell. Nonetheless, this\\nmethod of sexing embryos could allow male embryos to be removed\\nprior to hatching. Additionally, development of automated in ovo sexing\\ntechniques could decrease costs and labour associated with the cur-\\nrently used practice of manually sexing day-old embryos by skilled\\nworkers.\\nDigital imaging, vocalization analysis, infrared thermal imaging and\\nraman spectroscopy are all non-invasive techniques that can assess\\nwelfare or health parameters of large numbers of poultry collectively.\\nThese techniques are of high importance for the poultry industry\\ncompared to other livestock industries,including the dairy industry,\\nwhere animal value provides suﬃcient incentive to monitor individual\\ndairy cows, resulting in the development of numerous wearable sensor\\ntechnologies (Neethirajan et al., 2017). Nonetheless, there are still\\nbarriers to implementation of non-invasive technologies in the poultry\\nindustry, and research and development in these areas are required for\\ntheir eventual use. For example, the presence of background noise in\\ncommercial poultry houses could interfere with systems of vocalization\\nanalysis. Additionally, in the context of infectious disease diagnosis,\\nvocalization analysis has demonstrated some non-speciﬁc detection due\\nto age related patterns of sound production (Carroll et al., 2014), thus\\nemphasis should be placed on the vocalization data used to train sys-\\ntems for vocalization analysis for welfare monitoring. Also, some ima-\\nging techniques fail to capture enough detail for accurate assessment of\\nwelfare, for example, one ﬂaw of broiler footpad imaging technology\\nfor footpad dermatitis detection is the inability to gauge the depth of\\nfootpad lesions. Raman spectroscopy-based sexing of chicken embryos\\nalso faces barriers to implementation, as the currently studied system\\nrequires manual labour and handling of eggs. Although researchers\\nsuggest future development of automated systems that perform raman\\nspectroscopy for egg sexing in large hatcheries (Galli et al., 2016), this\\nremains to be seen. Nevertheless, the development of in ovo technolo-\\ngies in the poultry industry has resulted in the ability to automate the\\ninjection of over 25,000 eggs per hour (Peebles, 2018), and there is\\npotential for the development of similar systems for automated mass\\nsexing of embryos.\\n3. Rapid detection/point of care diagnostics\\nPoultry diseases can pose a signiﬁcant health threat to both animals\\nand humans. Smart poultry management practices can mitigate the risk\\nof infection and disease through rapid diagnosis and detection of in-\\nfectious disease. Point of care diagnostics describes the ability to per-\\nform a medical diagnostic test outside of the laboratory setting in the\\narea where a patient can receive care. This is ideal for poultry\\noperations, as faster detection and diagnosis can lead to faster treat-\\nment, potentially decreasing spread of infectious disease to other birds.\\nMany new technologies that make this feasible are being explored\\ncurrently. The following section highlights two types of sensor tech-\\nnologies, wearable sensors and biosensors, that have demonstrated\\npotential for detection of avian inﬂuenza virus in poultry, followed by\\nan overview of the advantages and drawbacks each type of technology\\nprovides.\\n3.1. Wearable sensors for avian inﬂuenza virus detection\\nThe threat of infection with inﬂuenza virus is a prominent concern\\nfor poultry farms. Rapid detection of inﬂuenza virus is crucial for the\\npoultry industry, as earlier detection allows for preventative measures\\nto be taken sooner before infection spreads within farms or to other\\nfarms. Traditional protocols for poultry inﬂuenza diagnosis consist of\\ncollecting samples from chickens after clinical signs are present, fol-\\nlowed by virus culture techniques or by PCR based techniques. This\\nresults in an extended period of time before diagnosis is conﬁrmed and\\nis very labour intensive (Neethirajan et al., 2017). This predicament has\\nled to the development of experimental wearable sensors that can de-\\ntermine inﬂuenza virus infection in chickens by detecting changes in\\nphysiology and movement patterns such as the sensor developed by\\nOkada et al. (2009). These parameters change signiﬁcantly when a bird\\nis infected with a highly pathogenic subtype of inﬂuenza virus, such as\\nH5N1 avian inﬂuenza virus. The sensor developed by Okada et al.\\n(2009) weighed approximately 5 g which was light enough to not in-\\nterfere with normal chicken movement. Infection-induced weakness\\nand fever were detected by researchers prior to death following ex-\\nperimental infection of chickens with a highly pathogenic inﬂuenza\\nvirus. Okada et al. (2014) have since demonstrated that measuring only\\nmovement patterns using an accelerometer versus only measuring body\\ntemperature can provide faster and more accurate detection of H5N1\\nvirus infection in chickens. Importantly, due to their frequent in-\\ncorporation into many smart devices used in current society, accel-\\nerometers represent a relatively low-cost sensor technology.\\n3.2. Biosensors for avian inﬂuenza virus\\nBiosensors employ a bioreceptor that uses a ﬁxed molecule, in-\\ncluding proteins, nucleic acids, or other materials, that is capable of\\ndetecting the presence of an entity (pathogen, protein, nucleic acid and\\nothers) in a sample and can transduce this recognition into either a\\nvisual or electrical signal (Luka et al., 2015). Importantly, many bio-\\nsensors are currently being developed that are able to speciﬁcally detect\\ninﬂuenza virus, however, detection can be limited to one subtype.\\nThese types of biosensors rely on detection of speciﬁc molecular entities\\nthat are present on the virus. For example, Chen & Neethirajan (2015)\\ndeveloped an assay that could detect the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of\\ninﬂuenza virus. This sensor assay utilized a dual-probe system in which\\nboth probes must bind to the HA protein. Importantly, this sensor is\\ncapable of detecting HA proteins of both H1 and H5 viruses, the latter\\nrepresenting viruses that have the capacity to cause pandemics in hu-\\nmans.\\nBoth of these sensor technologies are associated with advantages\\nand drawbacks if implemented in poultry production operations.\\nImportantly, due to being continuously active, wearable biosensors\\npermit transmission of data in real-time. This could allow for immediate\\nnotiﬁcation to producers of physiological signs associated with infec-\\ntion with inﬂuenza virus. However, due to ﬁnancial and logistical\\nreasons, wearable biosensors would likely have to be worn by a re-\\npresentative sample of birds in a ﬂock, and it is unknown whether a\\nsystem like this can enable detection as rapidly as experimentally de-\\nmonstrated. Additionally, one of the main drawbacks of wearable\\nsensors for inﬂuenza virus is the lack of speciﬁc diagnosis, as other\\nfactors can aﬀect bird physiology and movement patterns, leading to\\nJ.

Biosensors provide a speciﬁc diagnosis of in-\\nﬂuenza virus which is their major advantage. However, unlike wearable\\nsensors, biosensors require manual sampling and operation, and\\ntherefore would likely only be used after clinical signs are detected in\\ninfected birds. Potentially, systems that rely on wearable sensors for\\nrapid detection, along with biosensors for rapid and accurate diagnosis\\ncould be implemented for avian inﬂuenza virus detection/diagnosis in\\naddition to other economically relevant poultry pathogens.\\n4. PLF technologies and data\\nAs new sensors and technologies become incorporated into poultry\\nfarming operations, large amounts of data will be generated. Collecting,\\ninterpreting and applying all of these data will become a challenge for\\npoultry operations (Banhazi, 2009). These data will have to be elec-\\ntronically stored and processed in order to be understood and utilized\\nby producers. As data are generated by newly incorporated technolo-\\ngies, systems of data collection, storage and access must be established\\nto maximize the usefulness of these technologies. The following section\\nhighlights collection, storage and access of data for poultry production\\nsystems, in addition to mentioning data governance issues that will\\narise in data enabled systems of poultry production.\\n4.1. Data collection and storage\\nAs data are generated on poultry farms, one option exists for data to\\nbe collected and stored centrally in a data warehouse (Banhazi, 2009).\\nData warehouses provide the ability to store data in a suitable form for\\nanalysis, for example, Schuetz et al., (2018) implemented a data\\nwarehouse to store and analyze data for precision dairy farming pur-\\nposes. Datasets could include biological and environmental measures,\\nsuch as: temperature, humidity, ammonia/carbon dioxide levels,\\nweight, feeding rate, activity, vocalization, infection status and other\\nphysiological measures. These data would be captured by environ-\\nmental sensors, cameras, microphones, infrared cameras, wearable\\nsensors, biosensors and other sensor technologies. These inputs must be\\nconverted into an electronic form that can be easily stored and dis-\\nplayed simply to make sense of data (Smith et al., 2015). Storing data is\\nan important part of employing smart management systems on poultry\\nfarms, and as datasets grow in size, storage of data becomes more cri-\\ntical. One possible system that can be used to store large amounts of\\ndata are distributed storage systems, which store data on multiple\\nservers. According to Chen et al. (2014) there are certain attributes that\\ndistributed data storage systems have to be able to exhibit, including\\nconsistency, availability, and partition tolerance. As storage on dis-\\ntributed networks includes multiple copies of data being stored on\\ndiﬀerent servers, consistency refers to maintaining the identical nature\\nof these diﬀerent copies of data. Availability of a distributed storage\\nsystem means that if a server is to crash, other servers will still be\\navailable. Partition tolerance of a distributed storage system is ex-\\nhibited when a node in the network fails, yet total network failure does\\nnot occur, and the distributed storage system can still function when the\\nnetwork becomes partitioned. In addition to distributed storage sys-\\ntems, other data storage systems exist such as cloud based platforms\\nand hybrid storage systems (Wolfert et al., 2017).\\n4.2. Data access\\nAccessibility to data is essential for smart poultry management\\nsystems. Importance must be placed on the interface where the data are\\nmade available, and ﬁgures and messages that producers can easily\\ninterpret are necessary. Poultry producers will likely have the main\\ninterest and use for farm data; however, data can be made available to\\nother parties involved in the poultry value chain (Davies, 2016), in-\\ncluding feed suppliers, bird suppliers and veterinarians, in addition to\\npoultry industry regulators and to integrators in vertically integrated\\npoultry production systems. For example, data on bird physiology and\\nhealth may be better suited for a veterinarian to observe directly, ad-\\nditionally, technology could allow veterinarians to remotely monitor\\ndata from birds on the farm, providing a superior level of care. There\\nare currently companies producing software that can be used to convert\\nfarm data into ﬁgures for producers. Software can be installed on\\nmultiple devices, allowing the producer to observe farm data from\\nmultiple poultry houses or farms remotely from their laptop or smart-\\nphone.\\n4.3. Data governance\\nData governance will be a prominent issue for data enabled poultry\\nproduction systems in the future. Data governance is a concept that\\nincorporates a number of diﬀerent procedures, technical systems, pro-\\ncesses and strategies that function to ensure that data can eﬀectively\\nserve a purpose (Information Builders, 2011). It also encompasses data\\nprivacy and security, which are important aspects for poultry produ-\\ncers. For data to be best used in poultry farming operations, it should be\\naccessible and available to multiple groups and to other producers,\\nhowever, there is a lack of trust currently felt by agricultural producers\\nconcerning ownership and third-party usage of data generated on farms\\n(Wiseman et al., 2018). Availability of producer data has some potential\\nto cause ﬁnancial losses to producers, for example, via ﬁrst-degree price\\nﬁxing, where suppliers modify prices based on attributes of farm pro-\\nduction (Sykuta, 2016). However, in vertically integrated systems of\\npoultry production, risks associated with the sharing of producer data\\nare decreased. Going forward, as farm generated data begins to play a\\nlarger role in poultry production management decisions, design and\\nimplementation of data governance policies should be a focus.\\n5. Smart poultry management: Roles of big data analytics and the\\ninternet of things (IoT)\\nPractices in the poultry industry have already been advanced by the\\nimplementation of PLF technologies in various areas, including auto-\\nmated systems for weighing birds and determining feed and water\\nconsumption, in addition to poultry barn imaging technologies for bird\\nbehaviour analysis. These technologies will continue to be developed\\nand will allow producers to increase the size of poultry production\\nsystems and raise more birds leading to greater levels of production.\\nNevertheless, PLF technologies in the poultry production industry have\\ngreater potential than simple feedback loops that monitor a single\\nparameter leading to human intervention or simple automated changes.\\nRather, PLF technologies provide the potential to collect relevant pro-\\nduction-related data in real-time, and with advanced systems of ana-\\nlytics, important inferences can be made from the data leading to better\\ndecision making, better management practices and greater levels of\\nproduction. New advanced technologies and systems make this pos-\\nsible. This section provides a critical discussion of how big data ana-\\nlytics and the internet of things (IoT) can beneﬁt systems of poultry\\nproduction.\\n5.1. Big data and smart poultry farming\\nBig data refers to the collection and analysis of datasets described by\\nvolume, variety and velocity, and the resultant enhanced decision\\nmaking abilities that result (Sicular, 2013). Detailed review of big data\\nanalytics in agriculture has revealed a lack of research concerning its\\nuse in livestock farming (Kamilaris et al., 2017). Big data analytics\\ncurrently provide industries and corporations with many new abilities,\\nand there are plenty of reasons why employing systems of big data\\nanalytics in the poultry industry will be beneﬁcial. With some excep-\\ntions, such as for genetics and breeding, the uses for big data in the\\npoultry industry have remained largely underexplored, but possibilities\\nfor its applications are exciting and are an important tool that will help\\nJ.

According to\\nWolfert et al. (2017), in order to make use of data for smart farming,\\ndata must be extracted from diﬀerent sources and integrated into a\\nplatform that allows for analysis. Initial data preprocessing will be\\nimportant for poultry operations, as it will decrease the data that must\\nbe stored, thereby increasing storage eﬃciency and improving the ac-\\ncuracy of future analyses to be performed (Chen et al., 2014). Crucial\\ndata preprocessing strategies include cleaning and integration of data.\\nThe main goal of data cleaning is to identify errors and duplicates in the\\ndata, manage missing data, ﬁnd inconsistencies and reduce data attri-\\nbutes. Reducing redundancy in data is also crucial as images, videos\\nand audio recordings, all of which will be important for poultry pro-\\nduction, include a large amount of redundancy.\\nThe mechanisms in which big data provides value to corporations\\nand industries has been reviewed, and includes tools such as trans-\\nparency, experimentation, tailoring of services or products and ad-\\nvanced decision making (Manika et al., 2011). These beneﬁts are all\\napplicable to the poultry industry. For example, big data is able to\\ncreate transparency, meaning that data are more readily available to\\napplicable stakeholders. In the case of the poultry industry, the primary\\nstakeholder is the producer, and transparency relates to the availability\\nof data regarding health, weight, growth, production and welfare status\\nof birds. Transparency also allows other stakeholders involved in\\npoultry production to use data to aid in decision making. For example,\\nif feed suppliers have access to data regarding bird weight or certain\\nhealth parameters, modiﬁcations to feed could result. Another im-\\nportant tool that big data analytics enables is experimentation in order\\nto expose the strengths, needs, ﬂaws and variability in an operation. As\\ncorporations collect data regarding numerous variables, it becomes\\npossible to manipulate certain inputs and track changes in a desired\\noutput. This application of big data is very valuable for poultry op-\\nerations. Potentially, this could be used to achieve optimal rates of\\nproduction through manipulation of diﬀerent inputs that aﬀect pro-\\nduction, including factors that aﬀect the poultry house environment, or\\nstrategies related to feeding. This creates a system where outcomes of\\nmanagement changes can be accurately monitored allowing production\\nto be further optimized on poultry farms.\\nBig data also allows corporations to better serve consumers by\\ncollecting data on consumer trends and modifying products or services\\nto more selectively suit speciﬁc consumer needs (Brown et al., 2011).\\nFurthermore, this allows corporations to detect diﬀerent preferences\\namong segmented groups of consumers, allowing for products or ser-\\nvices to be tailored or advertised more speciﬁcally to these groups. As\\ndata are collected from diﬀerent poultry farms or diﬀerent poultry\\nhouses on one farm, slight diﬀerences in production can be detected,\\nleading to changes in the management practices of diﬀerent farms or\\nhouses, resulting in optimal production from poultry operations.\\nPerhaps the most valuable advantage that big data analytics can\\nprovide is the ability to create decision support systems for making\\ncomplex decisions that humans may not be capable of making. Big data\\nanalytics can incorporate large volumes of data from various sources\\ninto decision support systems, leading to decisions that minimize risk\\nand make key insights in the data that potentially would remain un-\\nnoticed by regular analysis methods. Poultry operations could beneﬁt\\ngreatly from big data driven decision making platforms. It is this aspect\\nof big data analytics that will allow producers to signiﬁcantly increase\\nproduction while minimizing resource utilization.\\n5.2. The internet of things (IoT) and smart poultry farming\\nThe IoT is a description of infrastructure where a huge variety of\\ndevices are connected to the internet, leading to massive changes re-\\ngarding the way humans live and work (Morgan, 2014). IoT infra-\\nstructure consists of several components including hardware to collect\\ndata from the environment, connectivity to transmit data, software to\\nstore, analyze and process data, and an interface so that users can\\ninteract with the IoT platform. This review focused on IoT devices that\\ncollect data from the poultry house, including environmental sensors,\\nwearable sensors and imaging and audio recording devices. The IoT has\\nfar reaching implications in the agricultural sector and will be a part of\\nsmart poultry farms in the future. Implementation of IoT technologies\\nin systems of poultry production will consist of a variety of internet\\nconnected smart devices that enable enhanced device communications,\\nleading to some farm operations becoming automated, leaving humans\\nto only monitor farms and act on processes that require a much higher\\nlevel of intelligence (Wolfert et al., 2017).\\nThe main advantage the IoT provides for the poultry industry is the\\ncapability for communication between sensors and equipment that are\\nused on the farm. An important feature of PLF is automation of pro-\\ncedures in an eﬀort to automate mundane tasks and enhance the eﬃ-\\nciency of management practices (Banhazi, 2009). In an IoT network,\\nvarious device communications can exist, such as device-device com-\\nmunication, human-device communication and device-human com-\\nmunication (Bello and Zeadally, 2015). Simple communications could\\nlead to automation of many procedures, for example, low levels of feed\\ncould signal an automatic order to feed suppliers, or high levels of\\nhumidity and ammonia gas sensed by environmental sensors could send\\na signal to increase the ventilation rate. More complex multi-device\\ncommunications will face challenges that include a heterogeneous pool\\nof devices, individual device limitations (power supply, processing\\npower, storage) and inconsistent access to the network (Bello and\\nZeadally, 2015). To enable more complex multi-device communica-\\ntions, intelligent routing protocols/algorithms must be instrumented.\\nComplex routing protocols could oﬀer automation of higher order\\nprocesses on farms, making automation standard for numerous farm\\nprocedures. For example, current experimental precision feeding sys-\\ntems are capable of measuring the weight of broiler breeders before\\nadministering feed (Zuidhof et al., 2017), but with the use of radio-\\nfrequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tags, this could extend the information\\nthe feeding system uses to include previous feeding frequency, laying\\nfrequency, or physiological indicators of health. Devices that collect\\ndata on birds could then communicate with the feeding system leading\\nto a data driven decision being made. Additionally, implementation of\\nIoT infrastructure in the poultry industry will require processes and\\nprocedures for data governance, data protection and legal compliance\\nto be set in place in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data.\\n6. Conclusions\\nThe technologies and strategies that have led to increases in the\\nquantity and quality of production would have seemed inconceivable\\none hundred years ago (Taylor, 2009). The poultry industry must adapt\\nto meet the projected demand for poultry products, and poultry pro-\\nduction operations are an essential area where new technologies can\\nlead to signiﬁcant increases in production. The development of new\\ntechnologies and sensors brings about the potential to collect large\\nvolumes of data from poultry production operations. Systems of big\\ndata analytics will facilitate informed decisions. Automation of farm\\nprocedures will further increase the capacity of systems of poultry\\nproduction, and this is achievable with the implementation of IoT in-\\nfrastructure technologies. Incorporating PLF technologies, big data\\nanalytics, and the IoT in poultry farming practices puts forth a possible\\nsolution to help meet projected global poultry product demands. There\\nalso exists many challenges for these technological solutions, including\\ntechnical problems with sensors and devices and issues pertaining to\\ndata governance. However, this system also can be responsible for\\nmaintaining or improving the welfare of farmed poultry, monitoring\\nmore closely for outbreaks of infectious disease and providing con-\\nsumers with more transparency as to how poultry products are pro-\\nduced.\\nJ.

The livestock production is a billion-peso \\nindustry where many Filipinos are depending on. The \\nresearchers pursued this delving to address the need in \\nproviding an updated technology, to help poultry farmers. This \\nstudy tackles Poultry Management System, an IOT system that \\nautomates the process of giving feeds and water to poultry \\nanimals. An Android application was developed to set the time, \\nin which the user intends to give food to the chicken. Water is \\nconstantly provided to the poultry once the sensor detects that \\nthe water container is empty. As the feed and water tank gets \\nlow, a notification system is in place to inform the user about it. \\nA solar panel is used to charge the battery that powers the \\nmicrocontroller and motors. This technology provided a \\nrelevant result in upgrading poultry businesses that saves time \\nand effort. \\nKeywords-internet-of-things; Android mobile APP; solar \\nenergy; sensors; poultry

This scheme will earn a safe \\nenvironment and profit to the poultry industry.   \\n \\nKeywords— Internet of things, Wireless Sensor Node, \\nEnvironmental parameters. \\nI. INTRODUCTION \\nIn most of the countries, the demand for poultry meat is \\nincreasing progressively because of high protein, low \\nenergy, and low cholesterol meat. The high production of \\nchicken depends on the environment, breeding process and \\nthe active operations. To monitor and control the farm \\nactively, in most cases sufficient manpower is required, \\nhowever, in turn, it increases the production cost \\nsignificantly. So, it requires a mechanism that may manage \\nthe poultry farm easily for better improvement in the \\nproduction with lower cost. Usually, the poultry farms are \\nlocated in suburbs, away from populated areas. In Pakistan, \\nthe increasing demand for the chicken in   hotels, marriage \\nparties and the daily meal has earned increasing profit to the \\npoultry industry at large. At the same time, the increasing \\nglobal warming, particularly in Sindh and Punjab provinces \\nof Pakistan where the temperature in daytime rises to 51 C0 \\nhas been alarming to the health of people, animals, and \\nbirds. The preventive measures from the scorching sunlight \\nmay include plenty use of water, unnecessary travel i.e. \\nindeed the care.  The climate due to poultry farms is \\nhazardous to life. The reasons may include, the respiratory, \\ndigestive and behavioral disorders within the farms which \\nhave traditional environment monitoring and protection \\nsystems like, mud or baked bricks made farmhouse with \\nwindow openings and /or a yard. The standard set up of \\npoultry farm along with basic facilities including monitoring \\nand protection of the parameters discussed above are \\ndirectly related to the outcome of these farms. If these \\nparameters are taken care of correctly, the health of poultry \\nwill be good enough and profit will increase. This can only \\nbe achieved if poultry environment is cautiously monitored \\nand controlled.  The smart poultry farm discussed in [1] \\naddressed the temperature, humidity, smoke and weather \\ncondition. The advancement that has been made in the \\ntechnologies now make it possible for remote monitoring \\nand controlling system and thus reduces the manpower cost \\nand enhances the production [2]. IoT can be defined as \\nmany physical objects (having capability of sensing \\nsomething from the environment) connected to a WAN \\n(Wide Area Network) network to collect, share and convey \\ninformation for some analysis. With the help of these small \\nnetwork connected sensors or objects, we can easily control \\na certain system. There is a great extent of using IoT like a \\nsmart hospital, smart home, and smart traffic. Smart poultry \\nfarm system can be a good implementation of IoT system. \\nIoT can help the poultry farm owners to enhance production \\nwhile lowers the cost substantially. The size of poultry farm \\nis generally 60 x 120 meters. WSN based model is discussed \\nin [3]. Wireless sensors are applied in food and agriculture \\napplications [4]. Internet of Things (IoT) is an environment \\nof a complete and comprehensive variety of things/objects \\ninterconnected and capable of interaction with others under \\nthe umbrella of new applications. Main theme/flow chart of \\nthe Internet of Things as shown in Fig.1. Different type of \\ncontroller and monitoring devices are used to maintain the \\ntemperature, humidity, feeding, and watering inside poultry \\nfarm that may be controlled remotely. In some developing \\ncountries, there are certain issues, such as lack of water, \\nhard weather conditions, lack of infrastructure and transport \\nfacilities. For such countries, an IoT based smart poultry \\nfarming may help to resolve these issues up to some extent. \\nAs discussed earlier, there can be environmental monitoring \\nand controlling system which can be controlled remotely. \\nThese monitoring and controlling system are often based on \\nthe wireless network. Wireless communication is steadily \\nThe 2018 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things and Intelligence System (IoTaIS)\\n978-1-5386-7358-4/18/$31.00 ©2018 IEEE\\n1'),\n",

For these reasons, the wireless network has \\nan advantage over a wired network and seen as the best \\ncandidate to avoid the cable layouts and its management. In \\na wireless communication, the Wireless sensor network \\n(WSN) is most suitable for such type of environments [3]. \\nIt provides connectivity to different sensors while inter-\\nconnected with internet using a wide area network (WAN). \\nThe WSN is consisting of small sensor nodes, coordinator, \\nand internet gateway (WAN access) [5]. A remarkable work \\nis presented in the literature on use of IoT and related \\ntechnology and techniques [6-12] with their suitable \\nachievements. But a few parameters are missing in the given \\napproaches A sensor node has low processing and power \\ncapabilities than a coordinator. A coordinator is a powerful \\ndevice which has more processing capabilities and a good \\nbattery life. An internet gateway can be a cellular network \\nor any other internet access point. Poultry Industry is the \\n2nd largest Industry in Pakistan. Pakistan is considered as an \\nagricultural wealthy Country in terms of food and important \\nspot in Pakistan as the eggs and Chicken meat is critical and \\nrich wellsprings of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Poultry \\ngives rich natural excrement and is an essential wellspring \\nof pay and job to a huge number of farmers and different \\npersons occupied with united exercises in the poultry \\nbusiness. The health of chicken depends on the poultry farm \\nand associated facilities. The environmental conditions are \\ndirectly proportional to chicken health including the growth \\nrate. The design of a poultry farm mainly based on suitable \\nenvironmental conditions. The suitability of such conditions \\ncan only be achieved with proper ventilation, cooling, and \\nlightning.  \\nThis paper proposes the new model by using advanced \\nmodern technology to make traditional chicken farming \\nsmarter. The smart farm gives the environmental parameter \\nstatistics like temperature, humidity, Ammonia gas, weather \\ncondition etc. to the desktop computer through advanced \\nsensors and microcontroller. The farm is connecting with \\nsmarter devices like an application program, sensors, and a \\nmicrocontroller which gives Automation to the chicken \\npoultry farming. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFig. 1    IoT flowchart. \\nII. THE OVERALL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE \\nRemote and scattered sheds are not easy to monitor, manage \\nand mobilize, even controlled sheds are being controlled in \\nsilos, the staff and management is needed proper attention \\non a single shed in this industry, which is fully dependent on \\nthe local staff's performance, it increases staffs and needs \\nmore technical expertise to manage it properly.  As the \\nnumber of farms increases, the issues will be doubled. IoT \\nBased \\nenvironment \\nmonitoring \\nsystem \\nrequires \\ndevelopment and integration of many hardware and \\nsoftware components. Environment of the single controlled \\nsheds or 100s of poultry farms will be easily viewed on a \\nsingle dashboard, all attributes of the shed with respect to \\ntheir each zone, will be separately viewed and monitored, \\nany corporate poultry sector can view 100s and 1000s of \\nsheds, this will provide company as a one window \\noperation, company can centrally monitor or manage all \\ncompany level operations.

SENSOR NODE DESIGN \\nIn this work, we choose raspberry pi board, the raspberry pi \\nis the hub of Internet of Things and also called \\nminicomputer. It is a low cost about 35$, having low power \\nconsumption, pocket size computer. The raspberry pi has \\nflexibility to support different operating systems like \\nWindows, Linux, Raspbian etc. with different programing \\nlanguages. \\nRaspbian is \\nofficial \\noperating \\nsystem \\nfor all models of the Raspberry Pi.  \\nWe are using Raspbian with its C++ flavor. In our project \\nraspberry pi B+ model is used as shown in Fig. 4, as this \\nmodel has better specifications as compared to other \\nraspberry pi models and latest version. Raspberry Pi can be \\nconnected to a local area network through Ethernet cable or \\nUSB Wi-Fi adapter, and then it can be accessed easily from \\nanywhere in the world through SSH remote login or by \\nputty software by just putting raspberry pi IP address in it. \\nWe used Sim900 GSM module with pi for Internet \\nconnectivity and notification (SMS). Sensors are connected, \\nand Raspberry pi collects that data send it to Webserver \\ncontinuously. It also stores data for some time, take average \\nof it and send summary to owner, supervisor or concern \\nperson through SMS. Summary updates concern person \\nevery time depends upon need, summary comprises of last \\nhour or half an hour data. Huge amount of data is collected, \\nwe can use that data for analysis or future prediction about \\nenvironmental behavior in Poultry Farm House. \\n \\n \\nFig. 4    Raspberry Pi 3 model B board \\n \\nEach device consists of different sensors as shown in Fig. 5 \\nand send data continuously to the Web server using 2G/3G \\nand have predefined limits for temperature, Humidity, \\nCarbon-dioxide (CO2), Oxygen (O2) and Ammonia (NH3). \\nAlerts or notifications generated and send to Supervisor, \\nDoctor, and Owner of the Farm House to take desired \\nactions. \\nThe 2018 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things and Intelligence System (IoTaIS)\\n978-1-5386-7358-4/18/$31.00 ©2018 IEEE\\n3'),\n",

Consumer perception is that antibiotic-free produced poultry\\nis superior to conventionally raised poultry in spite of a lack of supporting scientific data [2]. A\\nwidely accepted definition of antibiotic-free poultry in the United States is that there is “no use\\nof antibiotics (including ionophore anticoccidials) at the farm.” That means that coccidiosis and\\nnecrotic enteritis prevention must rely on synthetic or “chemical” anticoccidials, or on live coc-\\ncidiosis vaccines, or on rotations between drugs and vaccines. The problem with this approach is\\nthat chemical anticoccidials (with the exception of nicarbazin) build coccidial resistance much\\nquicker than ionophores and must be rested for a prolonged period of time. Further, there are\\nlimited numbers of anticoccidials of this class on the market. Moreover, unlike the ionophores,\\nthe chemicals do not have an antibiotic effect that aids in the prevention of necrotic enteritis and\\ntypically nicarbazin is only used during the cool months. Additionally, live coccidiosis vaccines\\ninduce immunity by invading, replicating, and cycling through the intestines. The coccidial\\ninfection, therefore, damages the intestinal epithelium and predisposes the birds to necrotic\\nenteritis [3]. These intestinal health problems lead to bird welfare issues that must be addressed\\nin the antibiotic-free production system. Likewise, it is generally acknowledged that production\\nefficiency (weight gain, feed conversion ratio, mortality and yield) is adversely impacted in the\\nantibiotic-free production system [4]. Thus, antibiotic-free production results in a greater car-\\nbon footprint and is less efficient [5, 6]. Companies considering raising antibiotic-free poultry\\nmust be aware of the expected adverse effects on bird health, production efficiency, and cost.\\nKey words: Antibiotics, Antibiotic-Free, ABF, Poultry Production\\n2015 J.

Another study\\nshowed that antibiotic use in food-producing an-\\nimals in a worst case scenario contributes less\\nthan 1% to the overall antibiotic resistance prob-\\nlem confronted by the medical profession [11].\\nTrends in consumer preference like buying\\nABF products are based largely on perception\\nrather than scientific facts [12]. For example,\\nmost consumers do not realize that all chicken\\nmeat is ABF or contain levels below tolerances\\nconsidered safe for humans. Regulatory agen-\\ncies like the USDA-FSIS for decades have rou-\\ntinely monitored drug residues by sampling and\\ntesting tissues to ensure that no drug residues\\n(including antibiotics) are found to be above the\\ntolerance or maximum residue limit (MRL) es-\\ntablished for each drug [13, 14]. The poultry\\nindustry in particular has an outstanding record\\nof compliance with drug withdrawal periods and\\nresidue tolerances [13, 14]. A recent report en-\\ntitled “The Organic Marketing Report” written\\nby Academics Review, an independent interna-\\ntional organization founded by professors from\\nthe University of Illinois and the University of\\nMelbourne, states that the 25 years of fast growth\\nby the organic food industry has been achieved\\nthrough fear and deception [15]. Specifically,\\nthe report also indicates that more transparency\\nis needed as the USDA organic seal says nothing\\nabout food safety, yet many consumers mistak-\\nenly associate it with “healthier”, “safer,” and\\n“more nutritious” food [15].\\nAn important aspect of ABF production is\\nthe definition used or the requirements of the\\nfood store or fast food chain being supplied by a\\nproducer. For example, the definition of “no an-\\ntibiotics chicken” by the USDA-FSIS is “these\\nchickens have never been given antibiotics, in-\\ncluding in the egg.” In contrast, the USDA-FSIS\\ndefinition of organic chicken allows for antibi-\\notic use in the egg and during the first day of\\nlife of the chicks, the drug-free rule kicks in\\nthe day after hatching. According to the USDA-\\nFSIS the label claim “raised without antibiotics”\\n(RWA) means “no antibiotics in their feed, wa-\\nter, or injection including no ionophores” during\\nthe birds’ life. This strict definition of ABF can\\ncertainly make the growing of chickens and the\\nprevention and control of diseases much more\\ninefficient, expensive, and challenging.\\nCHALLENGES OF RAISING ABF\\nBIRDS\\nThere are numerous challenges faced by com-\\npanies attempting to produce ABF birds [4, 16,\\n17], these typically involve one or more of the\\nfollowing:\\n1) Production challenges (raising ABF, RWA,\\norganic, split birds or 100% ABF, separate\\nprocessing plants, etc.)\\n2) Management challenges (reducing stocking\\ndensity, increasing down-time, cleaning-out\\nmore frequently, maintaining ideal temper-\\nature, keeping strict biosecurity, reducing\\nstress, breed selection, etc.)\\n3) Health challenges (increased enteric and\\nsystemic diseases)\\n4) Animal welfare challenges (establish when\\nand how to treat, option to divert to conven-\\ntional program, etc.)\\nFor the purpose of this manuscript, we will\\nconcentrate on the main health challenges that\\nare likely to result from a company making the\\ndecision to grow a percentage of their birds as\\nABF.\\nHEALTH CHALLENGES\\nWhile some alternative compounds have spe-\\ncific physiological, immunological, and/or bac-\\nteriostatic effects in the intestine, none (to date)\\nconvey the range and extent of the effects of\\nthe antibiotics [18]. Other researchers have sug-\\ngested that the unique and highly reproducible\\neffects of the in-feed antibiotics may be due to the\\nprevention of immunologic stress [19] or their\\nanti-inflammatory effect [20] rather than their\\nantimicrobial effect, and this should be consid-\\nered when searching for new compounds to be\\nused as replacements. A producer raising ABF\\nbirds should be prepared to deal with a variety\\nof health challenges that for simplification pur-\\nposes can be divided into two main groups:\\n by guest on December 19, 2015\\nhttp://japr.oxfordjournals.org/\\nDownloaded from'),\n",

The prevention of these\\ntwo diseases is intimately linked as intestinal le-\\nsions induced by coccidiosis (especially E. max-\\nima), whether due to field challenge or live coc-\\ncidiosis vaccine are a well-known predisposing\\nfactor for clinical outbreaks of NE [3].\\nRemoving ionophore anticoccidials and an-\\ntibiotic feed additives is certain to cause prob-\\nlems in controlling coccidial parasites and\\nbacterial organisms, in particular, Clostridium\\nperfringens, the causative agent of NE in chick-\\nens and turkeys. Interestingly, both coccidiosis\\nand NE in their subclinical forms, are widely\\nrecognized as the most prevalent and costly dis-\\neases of broiler chickens and turkeys [21–23].\\nWithout use of ionophores in a coccidial pre-\\nvention program, control of coccidiosis will have\\nto be achieved exclusively with synthetic “chem-\\nical” anticoccidials or live coccidiosis vaccines\\nor, more than likely, rotations between the two.\\nThe\\nproblem\\nof\\ncoccidiosis\\nprevention\\nthrough the use of chemical anticoccidials, is\\nthat with the exception of nicarbazin, a synthetic\\nanticoccidial that has been successfully used to\\nprevent coccidiosis in chickens since 1955 [24],\\nthe remaining anticoccidials are only highly ef-\\nfective for a limited period of time. They tend to\\nsuppress coccidiosis almost completely and for\\nthat reason they are more likely to select for a re-\\nsistant mutant population of parasites. Once the\\nparasites have developed resistance to the antic-\\noccidial, they are likely to remain resistant for a\\nlong period, as there are not enough chemical an-\\nticoccidials available to allow extended periods\\nwithout use of individual chemical products. In\\naddition, a well-known adverse interaction with\\nhigh environmental temperature [25] restricts the\\nuse of nicarbazin to primarily the cooler months\\nof the year.\\nLive coccidiosis vaccines have been used in\\nrotations with chemical anticoccidials to seed the\\nchicken houses with vaccine strains of Eimeria\\noocysts that are fully susceptible to all anticoc-\\ncidials [26]. However, the problem with the live\\ncoccidiosis vaccines is that they induce immu-\\nnity by replicating and cycling a number of times\\nthrough the intestines. Along with the replica-\\ntion and cycling required to induce active im-\\nmunity, the parasites also cause damage to the\\nepithelium of the intestinal tract and this predis-\\nposes the birds to outbreaks of NE caused by C.\\nperfringens type A, a bacteria normally present\\nin the hind gut of chickens. This is the main\\nreason for which live coccidiosis vaccines work\\nmore effectively when an antibiotic feed additive\\nwith good anticlostridial activity can be added to\\nthe feed. Field experiences from integrators have\\nshown that Virginiamycin at 22 mg/kg has pro-\\nduced excellent results in preventing cases of\\nNE when live coccidiosis vaccines have been\\nused to prevent coccidiosis in chickens. This\\nmay be related to Virginiamycin’s potent activ-\\nity against C. perfringens as demonstrated by\\nhaving the lowest mean inhibitory concentra-\\ntion (MIC) among other antibiotic feed addi-\\ntives [27]. This could also be related to Virgini-\\namycin’s unique structure, which as with other\\nstreptogramins, is composed of two antibiotic\\nmolecules that work synergistically and are less\\nlikely to result in the development of resistance\\n[28, 29]. Unfortunately, the in-feed use of antibi-\\notics like Virginiamycin is not an option avail-\\nable to producers of ABF chickens. Therefore\\nproducers of ABF chickens have to rely on a\\ncombination of strategies designed to minimize\\nthe adverse effects on performance and intestinal\\nhealth resulting from the removal of antibiotic\\nfeed additives and ionophore anticoccidials.\\nA variety of strategies have been used by pro-\\nducers of ABF poultry to minimize the effects on\\nflock performance of removing antibiotics and\\nionophores from the feed [16]. Table 1 presents\\na summary of those strategies including the tar-\\nget or actions to be taken for each. Even when\\nall of these strategies are implemented, cases of\\nNE are still likely to occur at least in some cases.\\nIf a flock breaks out with NE or coccidiosis,\\nit should be treated with an effective antibiotic\\nor anticoccidial, respectively, in order to reduce\\nmortality, morbidity, and unnecessary bird suf-\\nfering.

Companies that pro-\\nduce both conventional and ABF birds and have\\nseparate processing plants for each type of pro-\\nduction system, are in a better position to react\\nappropriately to disease outbreaks and channel\\nthe treated flocks to the corresponding plant.\\nAlthough in some cases the use of alterna-\\ntives to in-feed antibiotics has helped in reducing\\nthe problems associated with producing chick-\\nens without antibiotics, the performance of these\\nflocks when raised at similar stocking densities\\nis usually below that of flocks raised conven-\\ntionally resulting in a higher cost of produc-\\ntion [4]. On average, this cost is approximately\\n20% higher than that of chickens raised con-\\nventionally. In a paper from a symposium on\\nalternatives to raising broiler chickens without\\nantibiotics, a well respected poultry veterinar-\\nian with many years of experience in producing\\nABF chickens in the United States concluded\\nthat although ABF and drug-free production is\\nfeasible, it comes at a hefty cost to the producer\\nand the health of the birds [17]. After a large\\nnumber of alternatives to antibiotic feed addi-\\ntives ranging from prebiotics and probiotics to\\nlive E. coli vaccines, oregano and organic acids\\nwere field tested, the author concluded that none\\nof them worked like an antibiotic feed additive\\nor were not cost effective [17].\\nSYSTEMIC DISEASE CHALLENGES\\nIn both chickens and turkeys, septicemic bac-\\nterial infections are nearly always caused by\\nstrains of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a bacteria\\nnormally present in the intestinal tract of both\\nspecies [30]. In many cases E. coli is not a pri-\\nmary pathogen but rather an opportunistic one.\\nIf the birds are stressed for any reason or their\\nimmune system compromised, the E. coli bac-\\nteria can multiply and cause a systemic infec-\\ntion that typically results in mortality and gross\\nlesions characterized by the accumulation of a\\nfibrino-purulent exudate. In other cases the trig-\\ngering agent can be a viral respiratory disease\\nlike Newcastle disease or infectious bronchitis\\nor a viral immunosuppressive disease like infec-\\ntious bursal disease, infectious anemia, Marek’s\\ndisease of chickens, and hemorrhagic enteritis\\nof turkeys [30].

Re-\\ngardless of the cause, birds diagnosed with sys-\\ntemic E. coli infection must be treated with\\nantibiotics to mitigate the disease and prevent\\nunnecessary bird suffering.

They will probably not endorse such policy\\nunless steps are taken to ensure that treatment is\\nnot withheld from flocks that need it regardless\\nof the economic consequences for the company\\ninvolved in the production of the birds. Addi-\\ntionally, another philosophical problem is likely\\nto emerge when a professional is asked to sup-\\nport a system that is less efficient over benefits\\nthat cannot be scientifically documented and are\\nonly perceived as such by consumers that have\\nbeen influenced at times by misleading adver-\\ntisements [2, 15]. Therefore, the overall impact\\nof ABF production should be carefully consid-\\nered before making a decision. The following is\\na list of well-known and documented negative\\naspects of production without antibiotics:\\n1) It is generally understood that there will be\\na loss in performance [average daily gain,\\nfeed conversion ratio (FCR), mortality and\\nyield] in flocks raised ABF [4]. In an effort\\nto minimize the loss of performance, many\\ncompanies will increase the floor space al-\\nlowance per bird placed, for example a\\ncompany growing conventional chickens at\\n0.23 m2/bird (0.75 ft2/bird) may increase it\\nto 0.27 m2/bird (0.9 ft2/bird). Therefore, in\\norder for a company to maintain the same\\nlive weight output, it would have to feed\\nmore tons of feed, build more farms and\\npoultry houses, keep the birds in the field\\nlonger (reducing the number of placements\\nper year for the contract growers) or a com-\\nbination of these.\\n2) By feeding more tons of feed, the company\\nhas to purchase or produce more ingredi-\\nents, mix more tons of feed at the feed mill,\\ndeliver more tons of feed to the farms, use\\nmore drinking water for the flocks, and dis-\\npose of more excreta and nutrients into the\\nenvironment [5, 6].\\n3) Because ABF production is less efficient,\\nthe cost of producing a kg or lb of chicken\\nor turkey is higher and consequently con-\\nsumers have to pay more for chicken and\\nturkey meat. A 1999 study by the National\\nAcademy of Sciences [32] estimated that\\nthe cost of not using antibiotics would result\\nin an increased cost per person for poul-\\ntry of between $1.36 to $2.76 per person,\\nwhen adjusted for inflation, and for today’s\\nUnited States population this would be an\\nadditional cost of $604 to $1,224 million for\\npoultry alone. Moreover, low-income con-\\nsumers would be impacted disproportion-\\nately by the higher cost of poultry and a\\nlarger percentage of their disposable income\\nwould have to be spent on food.\\n4) With the global trade and economy that ex-\\nists today, food preference trends in one\\ncountry, like the United States or other\\nfirst-world nations may have adverse, unin-\\ntended consequences impacting the world’s\\npopulation in other countries. For example,\\nby making production of poultry less ef-\\nficient, more cropland (a very scarce and\\nnon-renewable resource) must be dedicated\\nto the production of additional feed ingre-\\ndients to make up for the loss in efficiency.\\nTaking more cropland and natural resources\\n(including water) from the environment to\\nmaintain the same meat output is not a de-\\nsirable position in a world that is expected\\nto add 64 million people each year from\\n2015 to 2020 [33]. Producing more animal\\nwaste to maintain the same meat output gen-\\nerates more pollution of the environment\\nand a larger carbon foot-print, so contrary to\\n by guest on December 19, 2015\\nhttp://japr.oxfordjournals.org/\\nDownloaded from'),\n",

Finally, and more importantly, by\\nmaking the production of poultry less ef-\\nficient and requiring additional feed ingre-\\ndient resources for the manufacturing of\\nfeed, ABF production could create addi-\\ntional demand for feed ingredients and, con-\\nsequently, a rise in feed ingredient prices\\nthat impact both ABF and conventional pro-\\nduction. Therefore, ABF production could\\nmake animal protein less accessible to those\\nwho need it most, the undernourished and\\nhungry of the world [34].\\nCONCLUSION AND APPLICATIONS\\n1. ABF production is likely to result in signifi-\\ncant health challenges and its corresponding\\nadverse consequences on bird welfare.\\n2. In terms of residues in edible tissues,\\nall poultry production is ABF or at least\\nmeets FDA established tolerances, which\\nare deemed safe for consumers. Random\\nsampling of poultry tissues from conven-\\ntionally raised poultry by the USDA-FSIS\\nshows compliance with tolerances estab-\\nlished by the United States FDA.\\n3. In terms of food safety, there are no scien-\\ntifically documented benefits derived from\\nproducing ABF birds when compared to\\nconventionally raised poultry [2]. When\\nproperly cooked and handled, poultry meat\\ncontains no viable bacteria and dead bacte-\\nria cannot transmit antibiotic resistance to\\npeople.\\n4. ABF production is less efficient than con-\\nventional production with antibiotics, and;\\ntherefore, its higher consumption of feed,\\nwater, and production of animal waste re-\\nsults in a larger carbon foot-print making it\\nless sustainable [4–6].\\n5. If in spite of the negatives aspects of ABF\\nproduction, a company decides to produce\\nABF poultry numerous changes to its feed-\\ning, management, and health programs will\\nhave to be made in order to succeed, but\\neven successful companies will face higher\\ncosts of production, some of which may be\\npassed along to the consumers.\\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\\n1.

Rural poultry, in particular, is essential for the livelihood \\nof many resource-poor farmers often being the only asset they possess. It makes up about 80 \\npercent of poultry stocks in low-income food-deficit countries and significantly contributes to: \\n(i) improving human nutrition, providing food (eggs and meat) with high quality nutrients and \\nmicronutrients; (ii) generating a small income and savings, especially for women, thus enhancing \\nthe capacity to cope with shocks and reducing economic vulnerability; (iii) providing manure \\nfor vegetable garden and crop production.

In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and South Asia malnu-\\ntrition (poor nutrition) and undernutrition (inadequate nutrition) \\nare closely associated with poverty. These conditions affect the \\nimmune system. The HIV/AIDS epidemic sweeping through coun-\\ntries in SSA stems partly from extreme poverty and, with it, poor \\nnutrition.\\nWide variation in consumption of poultry \\nmeat and eggs\\nA recent survey of several countries found that 34 percent of \\nthe people surveyed in South Asia and 59 percent in SSA were \\nsuffering from severe energy deficiency (Smith and Wiseman, \\n2007). Both groups obtained 67 percent of their energy from sta-\\nple foods (cereal grains, grain legumes, starchy roots and tubers) \\ncontaining small quantities of only low-quality protein. Their aver-\\nage per capita egg consumption was only 42 per year, compared \\nwith a global average of 153. Stunting and wasting in children \\nunder five years of age, and slow mental development were seen \\nmainly in rural areas of SSA. Eight out of ten of those affected \\nwere among the poor. Diseases such as kwashiorkor and mar-\\nasmus, both seen in underweight children, are associated with \\ninadequate dietary energy and protein. Pregnant and lactating \\nwomen and young children are particularly vulnerable.\\nIn SSA, only 8 percent of dietary energy comes from animal \\nprotein, compared with an average of 17 percent in all develop-\\ning countries, and 28 percent in China. \\nChicken meat and eggs: a valuable source \\nof protein and almost all of the essential \\nnutrients\\nChicken meat and eggs provide not only high-quality protein, but \\nalso important vitamins and minerals. Worldwide, 2 billion peo-\\nple depend on rice as their staple food. Most eat polished white \\nrice stripped of many essential fats, the B complex vitamins and \\nseveral minerals. Other cereal grains are usually deficient in criti-\\ncal nutrients. For example, maize (corn) is a staple food in some \\nregions, but the niacin it contains is unavailable. Maize consump-\\ntion without supplements causes pellagra. Invariably the protein \\ncontent of grains is low and of poor quality. Net protein utiliza-\\ntion (NPU) is an index of protein quality, calculated by multiplying \\nprotein digestibility by biological value. NPU of grains is generally \\nless than 40. Rice is the exception, with NPU of about 60, but it is \\nlow in protein (7.5 percent). NPU of chicken eggs is 87. Generally, \\ncereals lack the most important amino acids for humans – lysine, \\nthreonine, the sulphur-bearing amino acids (methionine and \\ncysteine) and occasionally tryptophan. Eggs and chicken meat are \\nrich in these essential amino acids.\\nEggs are also high in lutein which lowers the risk of cataracts \\nand macular degeneration, particularly among people living in \\ndeveloping countries.\\nIn the least developed countries, the projected increase in egg \\nconsumption between 2005 and 2015 is 26 percent, compared \\nwith only 2.4 percent in the most developed countries (Wind-\\nhurst, 2008). Corresponding annual projections for poultry meat \\nare 2.9 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively (FAOSTATS).\\nAdvantages of chicken meat and eggs \\ncompared to other animal proteins\\nIn developing countries, the diet of people living in cities usually \\ncontains more animal protein than that of rural people, mainly \\nbecause urban people are more prosperous, but also because \\nthey generally have access to a wider variety of foods at local mar-\\nkets. In low-income countries, commercially produced chicken \\nmeat is well placed to satisfy the demands of a rapidly increasing \\naffluent, middle class who can afford to pay for broiler chickens. \\nFacilities and infrastructure for producing broiler chickens can be \\nestablished quickly and soon start generating. Not only is chicken \\nmeat seen as a healthy meat, but it is also the cheapest of all \\nlivestock meats. \\nA major advantage of eggs and poultry meat as human food is \\nthat there are no major taboos on their consumption. In addition, \\na chicken provides a meal for the average family without the need \\nfor a refrigerator to store left-overs. Meat from other livestock \\nsuch as pigs and cattle is kept mainly for special festive occasions \\nand celebrations, partly because of a lack of storage facilities (no \\nrefrigerator or electricity supply).

Breast meat contains less than 3\\xa0g fat/100\\xa0g. \\nAn average value for dark meat (skin off) is 5 to 7\\xa0g/100\\xa0g. About \\nhalf of the fat from chicken meat is made up of the desirable \\nmonounsaturated fats, and only one-third of the less healthy sat-\\nurated fats. There are much higher proportions of saturated fats \\nin most cuts of red meat, which also vary considerably in total fat. \\nChicken meat is therefore seen as a healthy meat. \\nChicken meat does not contain the trans fats that contribute to \\ncoronary heart disease, and can be found in high amounts in beef \\nand lamb. In Canada, values of 2 to 5 percent have been reported \\nfor beef and as high as 8 percent for lamb. The World Cancer \\nResearch Fund and others (Bingham, 2006) have suggested that \\nthe consumption of large amounts (more than 500 g/week) of \\nred meat, particularly processed meat, but not chicken meat, may \\nbe unhealthy. \\nPoultry meat is rich in the omega-3 fats\\nPoultry meat is an important provider of the essential polyunsat-\\nurated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially the omega (n)-3 fatty acids. \\nScavenging chickens are a particularly good source because of \\ntheir varied diet. The amounts of these important fatty acids can \\nbe increased more easily in chicken meat than in other livestock \\nmeats; so too can some trace minerals and vitamins. The recom-\\nmended dietary intakes (RDIs) of niacin can be met with 100\\xa0g \\nof chicken meat per day for adults and 50\\xa0g for infants.\\nBy feeding broiler chickens only small amounts of a sup-\\nplement rich in alpha linoleic acid (an n-3 PUFA), such as flax \\nseed, the n-3\\xa0PUFA in thigh meat can be increased from 86\\xa0mg \\nto 283 mg/100\\xa0g, and that in the minced carcass from 93 to \\n400\\xa0mg/100\\xa0g. To a large extent, the fat contents of the differ-\\nent portions determine the content and enrichment of PUFAs, \\nso dark chicken meat always contains more PUFAs than white \\nbreast meat.\\nPoultry meat can be enriched with several \\nof the important dietary nutrients\\nUnlike most other meats, chicken meat can also easily be en-\\nriched with several other important nutrients. A recent study (Yu \\net al., 2008) showed that by adding 0.24 mg of selenium (as \\norganic selenium) per kilogram of feed, the selenium content of \\nbreast meat was increased from 8.6 μg to 41 μg/100g, which is \\nmore than 65 percent of the RDI. The same amount of selenium \\nin the form of inorganic sodium selenite also increased selenium \\nin the breast meat, but only to 16 μg/100g. Selenium deficiency is \\nbecoming more widespread in humans because soils are becom-\\ning depleted and the foods grown on them are therefore lower \\nin selenium. The RDI of selenium is 55 μg per day. Selenium is a \\npowerful antioxidant and plays a role in the prevention of some \\nforms of cancer. A deficiency of selenium can cause Keshan’s dis-\\nease, a heart ailment in the young, which is common in parts \\nof China, and cognitive decline in adults. Enriched poultry meat \\ncould help alleviate this condition.\\nConclusions\\nChicken meat can make many positive contributions to the diet of \\nthose on low incomes. Although not all meat is seen as healthy, \\nchicken meat is, and is frequently more affordable than other \\nmeats. It is of a consistently high quality, is low in saturated fats, \\ncan be enriched with some essential nutrients and is sought after \\nworldwide.\\nReferences\\nBingham, S. 2006.

Her diet might consist \\nof a small amount of rice (50 g/day) but mainly sweet potato, \\ntaro, yams and cassava. Her family of five keeps a small flock of \\nnine hens and a cockerel. These should produce approximately 12 \\neggs and one chicken, yielding 780 g of edible meat, each week. \\nThis will give each member of the family 22 g of meat a day, and \\nthe child receives five of the 12 eggs each week, or 36 g of edible \\negg per day.\\nTable 1 shows the daily contribution that the eggs and meat \\nmake to the girl’s recommended dietary intake (RDI) of some es-\\nsential nutrients. These are mostly for a child of three to four \\nyears of age, but RDIs have not been determined for people living \\nin developing countries and are likely to be generous (by perhaps \\n20 percent), especially if “the law of diminishing returns” applies \\nto nutrient utilization, so that a low nutrient intake is used with \\ngreater efficiency, particularly from animal products.\\n The eggs and meat will provide the girl with all the critical \\namino acids and vitamin K she needs, 30 percent of the RDI for \\nfolate, 66 percent for vitamin B12, 30 percent for biotin and 29 \\npercent for iodine. \\nIron is especially important and often deficient, particularly in the \\ndiet of women in developing countries. It is known that the iron in \\nmeat and, to a lesser extent eggs, is highly available, unlike the iron \\nin vegetables; the iron in the chicken meat and eggs in Table 1 is \\nlikely to meet more than 14 percent of the girl’s daily requirement. \\nFolic acid in poultry meat and eggs is \\nespecially important during pregnancy\\nFolic acid deficiency is of major concern in almost all developing \\ncountries and has been shown to lead to neural tube defects. \\nThese can occur very early in pregnancy, resulting in severe de-\\nfects of the brain and spinal cord, stillbirths and early child mortal-\\nity. A recent survey in Uttar Pradesh (India) (Cherian et al., 2005) \\nfound that neural tube defects ranged from 3.9 to 8.8 per 1 000 \\nbirth – the highest rate in the world. Green leafy vegetables and \\nfruit are good sources of folic acid, but up to half can be lost in \\ncooking. Assuming that she is not a vegetarian, the 45 μg in the \\nmeat and eggs shown in Table 1, will provide a pregnant woman \\nwith 23 percent of her RDI for folic acid (200 μg/day, although \\nthis figure varies widely). The folic acid concentration in eggs can \\nbe increased substantially by feeding hens a folic acid-enriched \\ndiet.\\nThe family also benefits from the dietary \\naddition of meat and eggs\\nThe family of the infant girl in Table 1 will also benefit through \\nsupplementation of their diets with their shares of poultry meat \\nand eggs. Even when only half of the meat and eggs in Table 1 \\nare provided, they will still have a highly beneficial effect on a \\nchild by reducing many of the signs associated with a dietary pro-\\ntein deficiency such as low growth, kwashiorkor and poor mental \\nfunction.\\nConclusions\\nPoultry meat and eggs are widely available, relatively inexpensive \\nand can be of central importance in helping to meet shortfalls in \\nessential nutrients, particularly of impoverished people. The in-\\ncidence of several common metabolic diseases associated with \\ndeficiencies of critical dietary minerals, vitamins and amino acids \\ncan be reduced by the contribution of poultry products rich in all \\nessential nutrients except vitamin C.\\nReference\\nCherian, A., Seena, S., Bullock, R.K. & Antony, A.C. 2005.

This has \\nimplications for improved nutritional status, particularly of low-\\nincome people in developing countries. The technology simply \\nentails increasing the content of some nutrients in hens’ diets. \\nSeveral vitamins (folic acid, B12, vitamin E) can be increased in \\nchicken eggs. Examples of two trace minerals are given in the \\nfollowing.\\nThe benefits of increasing the iodine content \\nof the hen’s egg\\nAbout 1 billion people, mainly in developing countries, suffer from \\niodine deficiency, especially in India, Africa and China, often with \\nserious consequences. Iodine has several functions, especially as a \\ncomponent of two hormones (T4 and T3) in the thyroid gland. As \\na result of iodine insufficiency, slow brain development in the foe-\\ntus can result in stillbirth or mental retardation in the infant, and \\nin goitre, mainly in adults. Villagers without access to marine food \\nsources and in areas where soils are depleted of iodine are particu-\\nlarly at risk. Vegetables and grains grown on iodine-deficient soils \\nlack iodine, and even when they have the minimum level, much \\ncan be lost in cooking. Iodized salt is one long-term solution to \\nthis problem. It has been introduced into many provinces in China \\nsince 1995, but has not yet reached all provinces.\\t\\nA hen’s egg normally contains about 53 μg iodine/100 g edible \\nportion, which is about 33 percent of the recommended dietary \\nintake (RDI), although this varies. Inexpensive supplementation of \\na hen’s diet with 5 mg of potassium iodide per kilogram of feed \\ndoes not affect the bird’s performance, but increases the iodine \\ncontent of a 60-g egg from 26 to 88 μg; this is more than 50 \\npercent of an adult’s RDI (Röttger et al., 2008). \\nThE benefits of increasing the selenium \\ncontent of the hen’s egg\\t\\nThe role of selenium, known to be a potent antioxidant, has re-\\ncently received considerable attention (Surai and Dvorska, 2001). \\nSelenium is involved in the proper functioning of the immune \\nsystem and in reducing or inhibiting the progression of HIV to \\nAIDS. This disease is less prevalent in countries where soil has \\na high selenium content than in countries with a low soil level \\n(Jaques, 2006). Selenium is also required for sperm motility, and \\nmay reduce the risk of miscarriage.\\nThe United States Department of Agriculture has allowed \\nthe statement, “selenium may reduce the risk of some forms of \\ncancer”. It is particularly important in reducing the incidence of \\nprostrate cancer. A deficiency of selenium can have an adverse \\neffect on mood states, especially depression, and may be associ-\\nated with several other health-related problems, including heart \\ndisease (Keshan’s disease). The conversion of thyroxine (T4) to the \\nbiologically active triiodothyronine (T3) also involves selenium.\\nOne problem with selenium is that, unlike iodine, there are few \\nspecific symptoms of deficiency; consequently an obvious defi-\\nciency (with few exceptions) has not been recognized, although it \\nmay affect general well-being.\\nSelenium in plants depends very much on soil concentrations. \\nSeafoods are a rich source, as are some livestock products, includ-\\ning eggs and chicken meat. Again, the amount reflects the sele-\\nnium content of the poultry feed. Because humans’ daily intake \\nof selenium is relatively low, eggs are an ideal carrier of the trace \\nmineral; there is a maximum amount that can be transferred from \\nfeed, but transfer is efficient at low levels of inclusion. Selenium in \\nthe inorganic form is less efficient than in the organic form. Sup-\\nplementation of a layer’s diet with organic selenium at 0.4 mg/kg \\nof feed will increase the content of 100-g of edible egg from 20 \\nμg to about 60 μ g – the minimum RDI of an adult.\\n \\nConclusions\\nEggs are an ideal carrier for enriching human diets with some im-\\nportant dietary minerals. The advantages of this approach is that \\nit is unlikely to exceed the minerals’ safe upper limits in humans \\nbecause the amounts sequestered into the eggs are limited, irre-\\nspective of the levels in the hens’ diet, and quickly reach a plateau.\\nReferences\\nJacques, K.A. 2006.

Linoleic acid (LA), an n-6 fatty acid, is quite common \\nin foods and in most seeds containing vegetable oil, and a LA \\ndeficiency is unlikely. Very few plant foods contain the n-3 fats, \\nhowever, although some oilseeds (rape seed, soybean, walnuts) \\ncontain small amounts, while flax seed is rich in alpha-linolenic \\nacid (n-3, ALA), which makes up 22 percent of the oil. Most peo-\\nple living in developing countries are likely to have insufficient n-3 \\nPUFAs in their diet.\\nThe importance of n-3 PUFAs in human health has only recently \\nbeen recognized. It ranges from protection against some forms \\nof cancer, several specific diseases and conditions (heart disease, \\nbrain development, learning ability, and inflammatory diseases \\nsuch as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis) to general well-being \\n(Anonymous, 2002). \\nSome n-3 fats are more potent than others\\nTo be effective, ALA must first be converted into active forms \\n(eicosapentaenoic acid, [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) in \\nthe body. This is done inefficiently or not at all in the elderly and \\nthe very young. Human breastmilk contains significant but vari-\\nable amounts of EPA and DHA, which can be increased by provid-\\ning the mother with an n-3 fatty acid-enriched diet to the benefit \\nof the suckling infant. Infant formula, unless supplemented with \\nthese fats (which is uncommon in developing countries), contains \\nfew or none of them.\\nThe ratio of n-6 to n-3 is important\\nAn important feature of these essential fats is the ratio of n-6 to \\nn-3 in the diet. Ideally, this should be less than 4:1 (as in human \\nmilk) but in practice it is usually more than 20:1 and probably \\nmuch higher in developing countries, especially where there may \\nbe no access to seafoods, the major source of EPA and DHA. In \\nthe human body, this imbalance results in the rapid conversion of \\nlinoleic acid into the active form arachidonic acid (n-6), resulting \\nin the production of pro-inflammatory compounds. High levels \\nof linoleic acid elevate thromboxane, which stimulates platelet \\naggregation, leading to arterial blockage and a possible heart at-\\ntack.\\nElongation of n-3 fats and their enrichment \\nin eggs\\nChickens have the unusual ability of rapidly converting ALA into \\nDHA in significant quantities, and to EPA in lesser amounts. This \\nmeans that eggs can be enriched with these important fats, pro-\\nvided that there is an adequate supply of ALA in the hens’ diet. \\nThe diet of hens usually contains some of the n-3 fats, and 100 g \\nof edible egg typically contains 150 mg of total n-3; of this, DHA \\n+ EPA is about 20 mg. By adding 10 percent flax seed (2 percent \\nALA) to the diet of layers, the total n-3 will rise to more than 600 \\nmg/100 g. About one-third of this will be DHA + EPA. Rape seed \\noil and rape seeds can also be used to enrich eggs with n-3 PU-\\nFAs, but result in lower concentrations. These oil and flax seeds \\nare grown in many developing countries. When included in layer \\ndiets, fishmeal, fish waste and fish oil can also increase the n-3 \\nPUFAs in eggs, almost exclusively as EPA and DHA, but if used in \\ntoo high amounts may cause a fishy taint in the eggs.\\nHow much of the n-3 fats do we need?\\nAlthough there is no agreed recommended dietary intake (RDI) \\nfor the n-3 fats, some suggest an intake for adults of 2 to 3 g of \\ntotal n-3 fats per day, of which DHA + EPA should be 0.6 to 0.8 \\ng. An enriched egg can therefore make a significant contribution \\nto these requirements. Requirements for children are not known, \\nbut are likely to be considerably less than those suggested for \\nadults. One difficulty is maintaining the critical n-6 to n-3 bal-\\nance. This normally means reducing the intake of foods contain-\\ning significant levels of the most commonly used vegetable oils \\nthat contain n-6 PUFAs.\\nConclusions\\nAn increasing body of information highlights the importance of \\nthe n-3 fats in human health. They are especially important dur-\\ning pregnancy and early infant development. Seafood, the main \\nsource of the important EPA and DHA, is becoming expensive, \\nand its consumption is falling. There is generally a severe dietary \\ndeficiency of these n-3 fats in both developing and developed \\ncountries worldwide, causing a gross imbalance with the n-6 fats \\nand leading to adverse health consequences. The contribution of \\nenriched eggs will become increasingly important, especially to \\nvegetarians, whose diet has only ALA and little or no EPA and \\nDHA.\\nReferences\\nAnonymous. 2002.

The standard \\ndaily recommended maximum intake of cholesterol is 300 mg. \\nImportant facts about cholesterol\\nThere are two not widely known facts: i) cholesterol must be in \\nthe oxidized (rancid) form to cause the arterial plaques that lead \\nto partial blockage of the blood vessels; and ii) some forms of \\ncholesterol are beneficial. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol \\n(HDL) protects against heart disease by mopping up circulating \\ncholesterol. The culprit is the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \\n(LDL) in the oxidized form that narrows or “hardens” the arteries. \\nOne way of counteracting this process is therefore to eat foods \\nrich in natural antioxidants.\\nA third important point is that the fat in eggs is in the unusual \\nform of emulsified oil, almost half of which is made up of healthy \\nmonounsaturated fats. This combination probably minimizes the \\neffect of eggs on blood cholesterol.\\nCholesterol is not a dietary requirement although it is found in \\nalmost every cell in the body, particularly in the brain and nervous \\ntissue. The liver produces up to 2 000 mg per day. Only about \\n50 percent of dietary cholesterol is absorbed, while the rest is \\nexcreted. \\t\\nIndividuals may respond differently to \\ndietary cholesterol\\nNot everyone responds to dietary cholesterol. There are hypo- and \\nhyper-responders (85 and 15 percent of the population respec-\\ntively). In one experiment (Elkin, 2006), men and women were \\ngiven 21 eggs per person per week, amounting to about 640 mg \\nof cholesterol per day. Plasma LDL did not change in the hypo-\\nresponders; in the hyper-responder group it increased by a small \\nbut statistically significant amount (10 to 15 mg/dL). Given the \\nunrealistically high consumption of eggs in this study (three per \\nday), it is surprising that the hypo-responder group did not also \\nshow an increase in LDL cholesterol. \\nReducing blood cholesterol with drugs\\nStatins are a group of drugs that inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA \\nreductase from converting HMG-CoA into mevalonate – an early \\nstep in the synthesis of cholesterol. Given the very wide functions \\nof cholesterol, this could be thought to be a retrograde step, but \\napparently it is not. Consequently, statins frequently account for \\na very large share of drug sales, as they are routinely prescribed \\neven for people with only mildly elevated cholesterol, who then \\noften stay on them for life. \\nCan egg cholesterol be reduced?\\nAttempts have been made to lower the cholesterol in eggs (El-\\nkin, 2007) by feeding different grains to layers, which may re-\\nduce egg cholesterol by about 10 percent. Feeding copper at \\n125 or 250 parts per million (ppm) can reduce cholesterol in \\neggs by up to 31 percent. Feeding garlic as a paste at up to 8 \\npercent of the diet may reduce egg cholesterol by as much as \\n24 percent, but there is wide variation. Other natural products \\nhave also shown significant but inconsistent responses. Genetic \\nselection for low and high egg cholesterol has met with little \\nsuccess. Although the cholesterol content of the egg is well in \\nexcess of that needed for embryo development, reducing egg \\ncholesterol beyond a certain point can decrease hatchability \\nand/or egg production. \\nCan we reduce absorption of cholesterol in \\nfood?\\nExcess cholesterol is removed from the liver as HDL cholesterol, or \\nlargely converted into bile salts, then passed into the ileum, ab-\\nsorbed back into the blood stream and returned to the liver. Some \\ncontinues to the colon and is excreted as bile acids. Compounds \\nsuch as insoluble dietary fibre and saponins, found in plants (es-\\npecially the yucca tree), can bind cholesterol in the small intestine, \\ncausing it to be excreted. Fibre also increases the rate of food \\npassage, thereby reducing the opportunity to recycle cholesterol \\nvia the lower ileum. \\nHow many eggs should we eat?\\nNearly half (45 percent) of the public in the United Kingdom still \\nbelieve that they should be eating a maximum of three eggs a \\nweek. A recent article in the British Nutrition Foundation’s Nu-\\ntrition Bulletin (2009, 34(1): 66–70) reveals that misconceptions \\nabout eggs and cholesterol stem largely from incorrect conclu-\\nsions drawn from early research.\\nMany heart and lung health organizations have done a com-\\nplete turn-about and some have even given eggs the “heart tick” \\nof approval. Although the recommendation of 300 mg of cho-'),\n",

Poultry products can also be contaminated with the \\nantimicrobial and anti-parasitic drugs or pesticides used on farms. \\nThe ingestion of antimicrobials can cause antimicrobial-resistant \\nbacteria to develop in humans.\\nCampylobacter and Salmonella infections are among the most \\nimportant food safety hazards. These bacteria account for more \\nthan 90 percent of all reported cases of bacteria-related food \\npoisonings worldwide. Most of these cases are related to the \\nconsumption of poultry and poultry products, but all domestic \\nlivestock are potential reservoirs of infection. Reported cases of \\nCampylobacter and Salmonella infections are believed to repre-\\nsent only a fraction of the true number of cases.\\nConsuming raw or undercooked poultry or poultry products \\nhas been implicated as a potential risk factor for human cases \\nof influenza H5N1 infection (HPAI). Poultry meat should be well \\ncooked, with the core temperature reaching 70°C for at least one \\nsecond during cooking.\\nData on food-borne diseases in low-income countries are \\nscarce. There is no precise and consistent global information \\nabout the full extent of the occurrence of food poisoning and \\nthe costs related to unsafe food. Symptoms are often mild and \\ncases are not reported, but their importance is thought to be \\nsubstantial.\\nRISK FOR CONSUMERS \\nIn many countries, eating habits have undergone major chang-\\nes over the last two decades. The middle class is growing, and \\nthis group of people eats more meat and goes out more often \\nfor meals. Migration from rural to urban areas has also resulted \\nin changed eating patterns. New food production, preparation \\nand distribution techniques have developed in response to these \\nchanges. There is a large increase in “fast food” and other ready-\\nto-eat foods, which means that consumers have less control on \\nthe selection, preparation and storage of the meat they consume.\\nChildren and people in stress situations, such as those facing \\nmalnutrition, war or natural disasters, are especially at risk of \\nfood-borne bacterial diseases. The main symptom is diarrhoea, \\nand infection can be fatal (with 0.01 percent mortality in infected \\npeople in high-income countries). As the causal agent is a bac-\\nterium, these diseases can be treated by antibiotics, but access \\nto treatment is difficult in many low-income countries. Another \\nproblem is the development of resistance to antibiotics among \\nzoonotic bacteria. \\nPRODUCTION SYSTEMS\\nBackyard poultry production is an important activity for many rural \\nhouseholds. Consumption of meat and eggs from this production \\nsystem is considered safe because of the habits usually observed \\namong consumers purchasing or preparing birds from backyard \\npoultry production. Preparation is usually just after slaughter. Be-\\ncause a chicken provides one meal for a family, there are usually \\nno leftovers. The meat is thoroughly cooked, which reduces the \\nrisk associated with the consumption of sick birds that is observed \\nin many poor rural areas. If birds are infected, there is risk of hu-\\nman infection with pathogens during the handling of live birds \\nand during preparation.\\nPeople with little or no experience of poultry farming may in-\\nvest in smallholder intensive poultry production and may build a \\nsmall broiler or layer chicken house, often near new settlements \\nor suburbs. In these small-scale operations, the use of antibiot-\\nics – which is sometimes adopted to compensate for poor per-\\nformance resulting from inexperience in management – is not \\nadequate. The risk of consumers ingesting antimicrobials and/or \\nantibiotics is particularly important.\\nIn general, poultry meat and egg products from large-scale \\ncommercial operations are subject to efficient control processes \\nand are safe. Large companies normally take considerable care \\nto avoid bad publicity resulting from the commercialization of \\nunsafe food products. However, one of the most common prob-\\nlems for large-scale commercially produced poultry meat in low-\\nincome countries is the lack of refrigeration during marketing. \\nTable 1 gives an overview of risk factors for food-borne diseases \\nrelated to the consumption of poultry and poultry products from \\nproduction systems in low-income countries.\\nREDUCING RISKS\\nThe appearance of clinical signs in infected humans, and the \\nimportance of these signs will depend on several factors. On a \\nchilled carcass taken out of the refrigerator, most bacteria need \\nan adaptation time of about two hours before they start to multi-\\nply. Usually, only high numbers of bacteria will cause disease, and \\nonly in more vulnerable people. Consumers can reduce the risk of \\nbacterial food-borne diseases by refrigerating the meat from the \\nmoment it is bought until the moment of preparation (heating) \\n1\\t  With contributions from Philippe Ankers, FAO'),\n",

In the past, most outbreaks were acute and \\nlocalized, and resulted from a high level of contamination. Now, \\nmore outbreaks affect several countries at once, resulting from \\nlow-level contamination of widely distributed commercial food \\nproducts. Risks of the contamination of poultry products by resi-\\ndues and bacteria exist everywhere, owing to the globalization \\nof poultry production and trade. Counteracting this, the relative \\nrisk of contaminated poultry products reaching the market has \\nreduced in the last decade, thanks to faster and more reliable \\ndiagnostic tools, the establishment of a world epidemiological \\nalert system, and overall improvement of hygiene standards. The \\navailability of efficient antibiotic treatments has also reduced the \\nimpact of food-borne diseases.\\nAs most food safety hazards related to poultry come from the \\nimmediate health risks of ingesting foods contaminated with \\nzoonotic bacteria, regulation and testing efforts have focused on \\nreducing the incidence of this type of contamination. Over re-\\ncent decades, the food chain approach has been recognized as \\na valuable step forward in ensuring food safety from production \\nto consumption. Such a system can also control contamination \\nwith pesticides and veterinary drugs along the production and \\nmarketing chains. \\nThe many and varied routes of contamination mean that many \\nactors have a role in reducing risk, including feed mill operators, \\nfarmers, chicken processors, retailers, supermarkets, restaurants, \\ntakeaway establishments, health authorities, legislators, govern-\\nments and consumers.\\nFlock health, the structure of the poultry food chain (short or \\nchilled), the quality of control procedures during production and \\nsupply processes and on the final product – all contribute to the \\nmarketing of safe poultry meat and eggs. \\nWHO has set up a Food-borne Disease Burden Epidemiology \\nReference Group (FERG), which harmonizes international efforts \\nfor consumption. Temperature and cooking time are critical in \\nminimizing risk. Contaminated parts are less likely to cause food \\npoisoning problems if the meat is well cooked. However, some \\nbacterial toxins are heat-stable, and will not be deactivated. Prop-\\ner attention to minimizing bacterial contamination and prolifera-\\ntion is required from slaughter until cooking. Coagulated blood, \\nblood pudding and chicken-and-duck blood soup can contain \\nharmful pathogens if not well cooked.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has elaborated the Five \\nKeys to Safer Food programme (http://www.who.int/foodsafety/\\nconsumer/5keys/en/). Messages for food handlers and consumers \\nhave been developed, to decrease the incidence of food-borne \\ndiseases. Educational and training tools have also been devel-\\noped.

China and Brazil, in particular, have emerged as major poul-\\ntry meat producers. Meanwhile North American and European \\nproducers have lost their global market shares. Over the last 30 \\nyears, egg production has also increased enormously in East and \\nSoutheast Asia. In 2007, about 45 percent of the eggs consumed \\nworldwide were produced in China (FAO, 2009).\\nINTERNATIONAL trade\\nIn most countries, poultry production is mainly for domestic \\nconsumption. According to FAOSTAT, only about 12 percent of \\npoultry meat and 2 percent of eggs were traded on the world \\nmarket in 2007. However international trade is increasing. Brazil \\nand the United States are the two largest exporters of poultry \\nmeat. Global trade in poultry meat and meat products involving \\nprocessing is complex.\\nMost of the poultry meat available on the global market comes \\nfrom large-scale specialized commercial poultry production sys-\\ntems. In low-income countries, imports of cheap low-quality cuts \\nsuch as wings, lower legs, necks and giblets sold by the piece, \\nmake chicken meat more accessible to the average consumer. \\nThis coincides with changing eating habits in developed coun-\\ntries, where consumers tend to buy chicken breast and thigh \\nmeat and, to a lesser extent, drumsticks. Poultry meat products \\nare usually exported frozen. \\nIn many low-income countries, particularly those with tropical \\nclimates, trade in frozen food entails risks. It is not uncommon \\nto see defrosted poultry meat displayed for sale on open mar-\\nket stalls without refrigeration, which presents a risk to human \\nhealth. The smaller the pieces, the higher the risk of contamina-\\ntion, owing to the increased surface area. Carcasses or cut-up \\npieces must remain frozen throughout the marketing chain. \\nWhen the refrigeration chain is interrupted, infectious agents \\nstart to multiply on the meat. The consumption of contaminated \\nmeat can cause diseases, especially if the meat is not well cooked.\\n1\\t  With contributions from Philippe Ankers, FAO\\nFigure 1 \\nPoultry meat and meat product imports and exports 2008, including live birds (‘000 tonnes carcass weight equivalent)\\n433\\n250\\n95\\n' #\\n180\\n51\\n$\\n510\\n1370\\n178\\n132\\n226\\n144\\n50\\n23\\n152\\n132\\n42\\n581\\n309\\n359\\n500\\n1225\\n221\\n17\\n230\\n535\\nSource: Gira Meat Club.\"),\n",

Authorities may decide to \\nclose these markets when there are outbreaks in the area, region \\nor country. In the medium to long term, authorities will encour-\\nage the purchase of poultry meat that has gone through a certifi-\\ncation process. Contact between people, especially children, and \\nlive poultry bought at the market should be discouraged.\\nOUTLOOK\\nGlobal demand for poultry and poultry products will continue to in-\\ncrease, owing to global population increase and growing per capi-\\nta consumption. Trade will also go up, facilitated by improvements \\nin transportation, infrastructure and marketing networks. These \\nfactors, and the rapidly changing regulations and rising standards \\nfor food safety in high-income countries, create both challenges \\nand opportunities for low- and middle-income countries. \\nFor many years, intensive poultry production units in high-in-\\ncome countries have approached risk management by focusing \\nfirst on risk identification and then using Hazard Analysis Critical \\nControl Points (HACCP) procedures. This approach is now adopt-\\ned by producers in low- and middle-income exporting countries \\nas well. The Codex committees provide advice on the introduc-\\ntion of such procedures. Regulatory agencies worldwide are also \\nincreasingly adopting the HACCP procedures as a foundation for \\nnew regulations to control microbial pathogens in food. Based on \\nrisk assessment, critical control points are identified in the produc-\\ntion chain, and adjustments in the chain will ensure the quality \\nof final products. \\nGovernments and the private sector must join forces to im-\\nprove capacity to react quickly to emerging food safety crises, \\nthereby minimizing human illness and financial losses.\\nAn increasing number of low- and middle-income countries are \\nexporting poultry and poultry products, and the adoption of in-\\nternational standards for food safety is essential. Brazil’s remarka-\\nAppropriate control of the refrigeration chain is therefore re-\\nquired, from port, to market, to consumer.\\nIf other food, such as salad, comes into contact with raw con-\\ntaminated poultry meat, it too can be contaminated and will be \\ndangerous to health when eaten raw. Cross-contamination dur-\\ning food preparation is another important risk factor. \\nIn countries where H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza \\n(HPAI) is reported, poultry meat can be exported only as pro-\\ncessed products (cooked, pasteurized) to avoid spread of the vi-\\nrus to other countries. In frozen poultry meat products Influenza \\nviruses are not killed by refrigeration or freezing, but human cases \\nof influenza H5N1 infection are mainly the results of direct con-\\ntact with live birds (Swayne and Thomas, 2008). \\nBacteria, such as Salmonellae, which cause Salmonellosis in \\npeople, also survive in frozen products, and can become harmful \\nwhen they start multiplying after defrosting. Antimicrobial-resist-\\nant bacteria can also be disseminated through trade of poultry \\nmeat products.\\nINTERNATIONAL FOOD SAFETY STANDARDS\\nFor World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries, the \\nSanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement defines the basic \\nrules for food safety and animal and plant health standards. It \\nallows countries to set their own standards, but these must be \\nbased on science. The Codex Alimentarius is a collection of in-\\nternational food safety standards that have been adopted by the \\nCodex Alimentarius Commission (the Codex), which was jointly \\nset up by FAO and the World Health Organization (WHO). Under \\nthe SPS Agreement, the Codex is the relevant standard-setting \\norganization for food safety. The Codex Alimentarius includes \\nfood safety standards related to poultry meat and eggs. Har-\\nmonizing application of the CODEX standards among countries \\nis a challenge. Consumers’ perceptions of the risk related to \\nfood consumption differ among countries, as do the availabil-\\nity of market information, the importance of risk factors at the \\nfarm level, and the standards for food processing and packag-\\ning technologies.

A study \\nin Guangzhou, China in 2007 to 2008 found that 15 percent of \\npoultry workers in live poultry markets, where the birds are also \\nslaughtered, had antibodies against HPAI. This compares with only \\n1 percent in the general population (Wang, Fu and Zheng, 2009). \\nHowever, there are also risks of human exposure to pathogens \\noriginating from the poultry slaughtering, processing, storage, \\nhandling and preparation phases. Poultry can be contaminated \\nwith harmful infectious agents, and raw poultry products are re-\\nported to be responsible for a significant number of cases of hu-\\nman food poisoning. \\nDuring these phases, controlling the contamination of carcass-\\nes by such pathogens presents a considerable challenge, espe-\\ncially in small-scale operations. In tropical countries, the ambient \\ntemperature is usually above 20°C, with a high degree of humid-\\nity creating favourable conditions for the multiplication of most \\nbacteria. During the hot season, increased numbers of bacteria \\nare found on poultry carcasses.\\nTo quantify the food safety risks along the production and \\nmarketing chain, it is important to know how, where and when \\ncontamination with microorganisms occurs. Once this is known, \\nit is possible to introduce risk reduction measures. The adoption \\nof improved technology and strict hygiene measures can often \\nreduce the risk of contamination of carcasses. The slaughtering \\nfacility must be divided into at least three separate sections: a \\nlive birds’ area; a slaughtering area, including defeathering; and \\na processing area, starting with evisceration. To reduce the risk of \\npathogens multiplying on carcasses, poultry meat and carcasses \\nshould be refrigerated or consumed immediately after slaughter.\\nThe native microflora of processed poultry is composed of \\nmany types of bacteria and yeasts, most of which are part of the \\nmicroflora of live poultry. This microflora is carried into the pro-\\ncessing facility on the body and in the intestines of the birds. For \\nexample, the bacteria Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella spp. \\ninhabit the intestines of healthy birds, and can cause disease in \\nhumans, depending on their pathogenicity and the number and \\nconcentration of bacteria on the product. The sum of these fac-\\ntors will determine whether the consumer is at risk at the time of \\nconsumption. \\nThe cleaner the birds are when they arrive at the slaughter \\nplace, the fewer the bacteria on their carcasses during slaughter-\\ning. On many farms, it is difficult to achieve low bacterial counts \\non the skin and feathers of birds, so emphasis should be placed \\non hygiene at the slaughter line. \\nLARGE-SCALE COMMERCIAL SLAUGHTERHOUSES\\nIn modern large-scale slaughter plants, appropriate equipment is \\nused and there are strict procedures for minimizing contamina-\\ntion. Nearly all procedures are automatic, and birds’ contact with \\nsurfaces or poultry workers is kept to a minimum; for example, \\nthe carcasses are scalded in a counter-flow system, with the water \\nflowing from clean to dirty, in the opposite direction to the birds. \\nAutomation enables the efficient control of hygiene, residues, \\netc. Although control systems are expensive, the large scale of \\noperations means that this expense will have only a marginal ef-\\nfect on the prices of final products. These technical solutions and \\ncontrols ensure delivery of a very safe product. If the processed \\ncarcasses are kept refrigerated and delivered rapidly to the su-\\npermarket, and kept there under appropriate temperatures, the \\nconsumer can be assured of buying a safe poultry product.\\nSMALL-SCALE SLAUGHTERING FACILITIES\\nIn small-scale slaughtering facilities, birds are killed and then \\nscalded in hot water. The carcasses are then plucked and evis-\\ncerated, mostly by hand. Before and after evisceration, carcasses \\nare often washed, which may contribute to the dissemination of \\nbacteria on and among carcasses. Further down the marketing \\nchain, trussed birds are often displayed on shelves at ambient \\ntemperatures until they are sold. Unsold birds may be put into a \\nrefrigerator overnight. \\nWhen ambient temperatures are moderate to high (above \\n20°C) the microorganisms will multiply quickly, resulting in rapid \\ndeterioration of the meat’s quality and safety, if the products are \\nnot cold-stored.\\nTraditional slaughtering during the hot season has been found \\nto result in a significantly increased incidence of bacterial flora on \\npoultry carcasses (Cohen et al., 2007). When carcasses are prop-\\nerly cooled (at 4 to 10°C), the growth of pathogens slows down.\\n \\nreducing CONTAMINATION OF POULTRY \\nCARCASSES IN SMALL-SCALE SLAUGHTERING \\nFACILITIES \\nBirds to be slaughtered should be clean and dry; the cleaner they \\nare the less contaminated their carcasses and meat will be (Bold-\\ner, 2007).

Blood, which \\ncan contain pathogens, is collected in the trough beneath the \\ncone and will not be splashed.\\nCommercial poultry processing plants defeather carcasses me-\\nchanically, after the feathers have been loosened by scalding (Ar-\\nnold, 2007). Scalding involves immersing the carcasses in hot \\nwater (for four minutes at 50 to 58°C, or by dipping several times \\nin water at 65°C), to loosen the feathers from the skin. In small-\\nscale operations, this scalding is often done in a cooking pan. \\nAn under-scalded carcass will be difficult to pluck, while an over-\\nscalded one will show torn skin or cooked flesh. Harmful bacteria \\nand viruses can survive the scalding process. In some cultures, \\nbirds are scalded in boiling water. This reduces the risk of spread-\\ning viruses, but may cook the flesh. The quality and temperature \\nof the scalding water are critical in determining the final degree of \\ncarcass contamination. The water should be frequently replaced.\\nCross-contamination among carcasses is an important prob-\\nlem during the defeathering process.

Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium of \\nparticular concern here. Where evisceration is done by hand, as \\nin traditional slaughter places, there is a potentially serious risk \\nof contamination with these bacteria. Infrequent hand-washing \\nexacerbates the problem. The primary factor contributing to \\nstaphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks is inadequate control \\nof temperature after slaughter, with the initial contamination of-\\nten being traced to poor personal hygiene by food handlers. If \\nslaughter is followed by storage at temperatures that permit bac-\\nterial growth and multiplication, toxins will be produced. Staphy-\\nlococcal toxins are noted for their heat resistance, and typically \\nthey cannot be inactivated by the normal heat processing of food \\n(Cohen et al., 2007). This means that once the toxins are present \\nin the uncooked meat, people will get sick even from thoroughly \\ncooked food.\\nWhere carcasses are rinsed (with a shower or spray), the wa-\\nter used should be of drinking quality. Washing with cold wa-\\nter reduces the quantity of microorganisms on the carcass in the \\nslaughter process. \\nFor good hygiene, and to wash away all the dirt and bacteria, \\netc., a regular supply of clean water is essential. Water should \\nalso always be available for personal hygiene and the cleaning of \\nknives and other utensils. Water quantity and quality determine \\nthe level of hygiene.\\nCross-contamination of carcasses can occur on working tables, \\nsinks or draining boards during processing. The best way of pre-\\nventing contamination of clean carcasses is to hang the birds. \\nAbattoir workers handling the carcasses and contaminated knives \\ncan also act as vectors for the cross-contamination of carcasses.\\nWhen preparing for sale, bird carcasses are sometimes put \\ninto plastic bags, which prevent further carcass contamination.

Newly hatched birds have a poor ability to \\ncontrol body temperature, and require some form of supplemen-\\ntary heating, particularly in the first few days after hatch. Many \\ndeveloping countries are located in tropical areas where minimal \\nheating is required. Indeed, the emphasis in these countries – par-\\nticularly for meat chickens – is on keeping the birds cool. \\nProduction systems\\nInternational poultry breeding and feed companies operate in \\nmany developing countries and have established large-scale com-\\nmercial farms in a significant number of them. The housing and \\nequipment used make it possible to exert considerable control \\nover the climate provided to the birds, but such houses are expen-\\nsive to build and operate, and require a large turnover of birds to \\nmake them viable. Owing to the lower construction and running \\ncosts, medium- and small-scale commercial housing is popular in \\ndeveloping countries. By far the most prevalent poultry farming \\nsystem in many developing countries is the small-scale scavenging \\nsystem, which usually involves only very basic (if any) shelter for \\nhousing birds. \\nLarge-scale commercial farms: Commercial houses in developing \\ncountries are clear-span structures with litter on the floor for meat \\nbirds or cages for laying hens. The commercial chicken meat in-\\ndustry in some developing countries is vertically integrated, with \\nsingle companies owning feed mills, breeder farms, hatcheries \\nand processing plants. Arrangements typically involve agree-\\nments in which the farmer or landowner provides the housing, \\nequipment and labour, while the company provides the chicks, \\nfeed, medication, transport and supervision. \\nFor controlled-environment housing of layers, multi-tier cage \\nsystems are common. Most large-scale commercial farms use \\ncontrolled-environment systems to provide the ideal thermal envi-\\nronment for the birds (Glatz and Bolla, 2004). Birds’ performance \\nin controlled-environment sheds is generally superior to that in \\nnaturally ventilated houses, as the conditions can be maintained \\nin the birds’ thermal comfort zone. Achieving the ideal environ-\\nment for birds depends on appropriate management of the poul-\\ntry house.\\nModern houses are fully automated, with fans linked to sen-\\nsors to maintain the required environment. Some commercial op-\\nerators use computerized systems for the remote checking and \\nchanging of settings in houses. Forced-air furnaces and radiant \\nheating are the main methods of providing heat to young chicks.\\nMedium-scale commercial: In developing countries, most medi-\\num-scale commercial layer and chicken meat houses rely on natu-\\nral airflow though the shed for ventilation (Daghir, 2001). Where \\nrequired, meat birds and layers are given radiant heating early in \\ntheir lives, to maintain body temperature. Laying hens may be kept \\nin commercial wire cages in open sheds, or in sheds with wire \\nsides to exclude wild birds, scavenging poultry and predators. \\nSmall-scale commercial (improved genotype stock and supple-\\nmentary feeding): Houses of various shapes and dimensions are \\ntypically constructed using local building materials consisting of \\ntimber or mud bricks and bamboo. These small-scale commercial \\nfacilities may have several rooms or compartments where chicks \\nare brooded, pullets are reared and layers are housed in a floor-\\nbased system or in cages. Meat birds are often kept in single-age \\ngroups of 50 to 100 chickens within the house. The house can \\nPhoto Credit: I. Aini'),\n",

During \\nincubation, the egg loses water vapour through its shell. The rate \\nof water loss depends on both the shell structure and the humid-\\nity of the air surrounding the egg. The quality of the hatch also \\ndepends on the age and health of the breeder flock, and on the \\nevenness and cleanliness of the eggs set. \\nFactors involved in poultry management\\nPoultry management involves monitoring poultry health; ensur-\\ning that the poultry house is maintained with appropriate brood-\\ning, rearing, growing and laying conditions; and ensuring that \\nrecommended vaccinations are given and appropriate feeding \\nprogrammes are used. In developing countries, it is often difficult \\nto achieve optimum performance from birds, owing to less-than-\\noptimal housing conditions and lack of quality feed, vaccines and \\ntrained staff.\\nBreed effects \\nOwing to their superior production, commercial hybrids of high \\ngenetic merit are often used in developing countries, but are not \\nwell-suited to tropical environments (see website on Poultry ge-\\nnetics and breeding in developing countries). These birds are sen-\\nsitive to changes in the diet and to high ambient temperature, \\nand require skilled stockpersons to manage them. Indigenous \\npoultry can cope better with the harsh conditions often prevail-\\ning in developing countries, and good management will improve \\ntheir performance. This can be achieved by using good housing, \\nprotecting the birds from predators, and providing them with the \\nenvironmental conditions that allow them to achieve maximum \\nprofitability. \\nTemperature effects \\nFarmers need to compensate for undesirable climatic conditions \\nby manipulating control systems or modifying the house to en-\\nsure that the welfare and environmental needs of the birds are \\nsatisfied. Environmental extremes (heat and cold stress, excessive \\nor inadequate ventilation, poor air quality) can be managed if \\nthe design of the poultry house is appropriate for the conditions. \\nBirds require adequate space, sufficient feed to meet their nu-\\ntritional requirements, and an adequate supply of good-quality \\nTunnel-ventilated broiler house: exterior and interior views \\nPhoto Credit: Robert Pym\\nPhoto Credit: Robert Pym\\nVentilation management\\nAll poultry houses need some form of ventilation to ensure an \\nadequate supply of oxygen, while removing carbon dioxide, other \\nwaste gases and dust. In commercial operations, minimum ven-\\ntilation is often practised in colder climates, but not generally in \\ntropical ones (Glatz and Bolla, 2004). \\nIn large-scale automated operations, correct air distribution can \\nbe achieved using a negative pressure ventilation system. When \\nchicks are very young, or in colder climates, the air from the inlets \\nshould be directed towards the roof, to mix with the warm air \\nthere and circulate throughout the shed. With older birds and in \\nwarmer temperatures, the incoming air is directed down towards \\nthe birds, and helps to keep them cool. Evaporative cooling pads \\ncan be placed in the air inlets to keep birds cool in hot weather. \\nTunnel ventilation is the most effective ventilation system for large \\nhouses in hot weather. \\nTunnel ventilation: These systems are popular in hot climates. Ex-\\nhaust fans are placed at one end of the house or in the middle \\nof the shed, and air is drawn through the length of the house, \\nremoving heat, moisture and dust. Evaporative cooling pads are \\nlocated at the air inlets. The energy released during evapora-\\ntion reduces the air temperature, and the resulting airflow cre-\\nates a cooling effect, which can reduce the shed temperature by \\n10\\xa0°C or more, depending on humidity. Maximum evaporation is \\nachieved when water pumps are set to provide enough pad mois-\\nture to ensure optimum water evaporation. If too much water is \\nadded to the pads, it is likely to lead to higher relative humidity \\nand temperatures in the shed.'),\n",

Use of a stringent quarantine programme to prevent dis-\\nease is an essential element of good management, and farmers \\nmust be able to recognize disease and treat it as soon as possible. \\nA suitable vaccination and medication programme is essential in \\ncommercial operations.\\nEffects of nutrition \\nManagers need to ensure that the diets provided to birds in com-\\nmercial operations meet the nutrient requirements of each age \\ngroup and strain of chickens (see website on Poultry feed avail-\\nability and nutrition in developing countries). Smallholder systems \\nin developing countries typically place less emphasis on achieving \\nmaximum production, and more on maximizing profitability by \\nusing diets comprised mainly of local feedstuff ingredients, rather \\nthan imported feeds. Key management practices by farmers who \\nmix their own feed include ensuring that micro-ingredients are \\nkept cool, mouldy ingredients are not used, and storage facilities \\nare weather- and rodent-proof. \\nImportance of good hygiene\\nAn essential management task is to maintain clean sheds, sur-\\nroundings and equipment. A clean shed improves health and lim-\\nits parasites, dust and microbial contamination, while clean shed \\nsurroundings reduce vermin and fly loads. This is important not \\nonly for litter and manure management but also for biosecurity. \\nRemoval of residual feed from feeders is an important practice \\ncritical to the health of the flock. Another important manage-\\nment task is to sanitize sheds to minimize the risk of disease to \\nincoming flocks of birds. Maintaining high flock health status is \\nessential, and routine vaccination programmes for a number of \\ndiseases are typically in place, particularly in larger-scale opera-\\ntions. Some vaccinations are carried out at the hatchery, but it is \\nessential that a proper vaccination schedule be established and \\nthat vaccination protocols be complied with. \\nLitter materials and management\\nBroiler litter is the material used as bedding in poultry houses \\nto absorb faecal waste from birds and to make the floor of the \\nhouse easy to manage. Common litter materials are wood shav-\\nings, chopped straw, sawdust, shredded paper and rice hulls, \\nand a wide range of other materials are used in different regions \\naround the world. Litter should be light, friable, non-compressi-\\nble, absorbent, quick to dry, of low thermal conductivity and – \\nvery important – cheap. After use, the litter comprises poultry \\nmanure, the original litter material, feathers and spilled feed. The \\nlitter quality in a shed is determined by the type of diet, the tem-\\nperature and the humidity. The recommended depth for litter is \\nbetween 10 and 20 cm. Sawdust can result in high dust levels and \\nrespiratory problems. Dust particles in the litter capable of caus-\\ning health problems in the birds are derived from dried faeces, \\nfeathers, skin and litter; their adverse effects arise because they \\ncarry or incorporate bacteria, fungi and gases. \\nManagement of lighting\\nPoultry have seasonal and daily biological rhythms, both of which \\nare mediated by light, particularly day length. For day length to \\nexert its controlling effect, there needs to be a dark phase (night) \\nwhen light levels should be less than 0.5 lux. Day length and \\nlight intensity during the breeder bird’s life have an important \\nrole in development of the reproductive system. The difference \\nin day lengths and light intensities between the rearing and the \\nlaying phases is the principal factor responsible for controlling \\nand stimulating ovarian and testicular development (Lewis and \\nMorris, 2006). The response to increases in day length and light-\\ning intensity depends on the body weight profile during rearing, \\nwhich in turn depend on the nutritional regime. The effects of \\nlight are predominantly on the rate of sexual maturation and egg \\nproduction. \\nThe two types of artificial lighting commonly provided are in-\\ncandescent and fluorescent. Incandescent globes are cheaper to \\ninstall, but have lower light efficiency and a shorter life. Fluores-\\ncent lights are three to four times as efficient and last about ten \\ntimes as long, but have variable performance in cold weather. The \\ncolour of the light rays has an effect on chickens’ productivity. For \\nexample, green and blue lights improve growth, and lower age at \\nsexual maturity, while red, orange and yellow lights increase age \\nat sexual maturity, and red and orange lights stimulate egg pro-\\nduction. Birds are calmer in blue light, so blue lights are recom-\\nmended for use during depopulation in commercial operations.\\nLighting programmes for broilers: Lighting programmes for com-\\nmercial broiler operations vary widely from company to company, \\nand depend on the strain of bird used, the housing type (naturally \\nventilated versus controlled-environment), the geographical loca-\\ntion and the season. Where light can be excluded from sheds, \\nbirds are typically reared under low-intensity (5 to 10 lux) lighting, \\nto keep them calm and to prevent feather pecking. During early \\nbrooding, 25 lux is used to stimulate feeding. \\nLighting programmes for layers and breeders: Light is critical for \\nthe onset and maintenance of egg production. Increasing day \\nlength (from winter to summer) during the rearing period stimu-\\nlates the onset of sexual maturity, whereas shortening day length \\n(from summer to winter) has the opposite effect. Early onset of \\nlay may not be beneficial as it may predispose to reproductive \\nproblems. Where artificial lighting is possible, a constant day \\nlength (of between 12 to 16 hours per day) during the rearing \\nperiod has been shown to result in a delayed onset of lay, and \\nis the preferred rearing treatment. Shortening day length or too \\nlittle light will discourage egg production, and must be avoided \\nonce the birds are in lay.\\nStockpersonship\\nFarmers and their staff play a critical role in looking after the birds \\nand maximizing productivity. They need to empathize with and \\ncare about their birds, and to avoid exposing them to adverse \\nsituations that may cause stress (see website on Poultry welfare \\nin developing countries). The people responsible for the care of \\npoultry should be well trained, experienced and dedicated. The \\nfirst task for poultry staff is to learn how to carry out routine \\nchecks on the birds, so they can identify what is normal in the \\nflock and what the signs of trouble are. Good stock attendants \\nminimize the risks to their animals’ health and welfare. By doing \\nthis, they allow production to reach its potential, while treating \\nthe animals with care (Barnett and Glatz, 2004). This is sometimes \\ncalled “stockpersonship”. Staff should be able to identify quickly'),\n",

On semi-commercial and commercial farms, they are \\nhatched artificially in incubators. \\nHatching fertile eggs using broody hens\\nOne of the important characteristics of village hens is their ca-\\npacity for broodiness. The large majority of improved-breed birds \\nhave lost this capacity. When broody birds are approached, they \\nmake a typical brooding noise and fluff up their feathers. Broody \\nhens prefer to sit on eggs in a dark environment that is protected \\nfrom predators, and they need a supply of feed and water. When \\none or more cockerels are present in the flock and have been \\nobserved mating regularly with females for a week or more, the \\neggs will normally be fertile (CTA, 2007). \\nQuality of fertile eggs\\nHatching eggs (stored at 16 to 17 0C) need to have good shell \\nquality. Storing eggs at higher temperatures promotes the devel-\\nopment of the embryo. In many developing countries it is difficult \\nfor village farmers or breeding centres to store eggs under ideal \\nconditions. Under high temperature conditions, the eggs are like-\\nly to “sweat”, allowing bacteria to penetrate the shell. Relative \\nhumidity should be maintained at approximately 75 percent in \\nthe fertile egg holding room. Higher humidity encourages mould \\ngrowth on eggs. \\nPre-warming of fertile eggs\\nEggs need to be warmed to room temperature for approximately \\neight to 12 hours before they are set in the incubator. The pur-\\npose of pre-warming is to minimize temperature shock to the \\nembryo and condensation on the shell. It also reduces the vari-\\nation in hatch time. Good air circulation is essential for an even \\npre-warming of eggs. \\nThe incubator room\\nOptimum results can be expected if the temperature in the incu-\\nbator room is maintained at about 25 0C. However, the tropical \\nclimate in many developing countries makes it difficult to main-\\ntain good incubator room conditions. \\nIncubators\\nIn small hatcheries in developing countries, incubators are often \\nsmall, still-air machines with a capacity of 12 to 240 eggs. The \\nrelative humidity must be 55 to 60 percent at set, and increased \\nto 75 percent after day 18. In small incubators, this is normally \\nachieved by placing an extra container of water in the incubator. \\nThe eggs are set in a horizontal position and are turned manually. \\nThe source of heat is usually a thermostatically controlled heating \\nelement or light bulb or kerosene lamp. Humidity is supplied by \\nwater in a container either above or below the eggs, and venti-\\nlation is controlled by small air vents. Circulating-air incubators \\nhave an electrically driven fan to maintain constant temperature \\nand ventilation of the eggs. \\nIn large-scale operations in developing countries, incubator set-\\nting capacity ranges from approximately 10 000 to 100 000 eggs. \\nThe equipment used to incubate and hatch chicks is all precisely \\ncontrolled (Cobb-Vantress, 2008). Optimum temperatures for set-\\nters are 37.1 to 38.6 °C, at a relative humidity of 60 to 70 percent. \\nThe hatching eggs are set vertically, with the blunt end uppermost \\nin the setter, and are turned mechanically through 90° every hour \\nHatching by a broody hen\\nKerosene operated incubator in small hatchery\\nPhoto Credit: Olaf Thieme\\nPhoto Credit: Olaf Thieme'),\n",

The eggs are then trans-\\nferred to a hatcher, where they are placed on hatching trays on \\ntheir sides, with the long axis horizontal, to allow the chick to \\nmove freely out of the shell at hatching. Hatcher temperatures are \\nusually slightly lower than those in the setter, to reduce the risk of \\noverheating, and are typically 37 to 38 °C, while relative humidity \\nis usually raised to about 75 to 80 percent. Hatchability should be \\nin the range of 80 to 90 percent for imported hybrid strains, but \\nvaries with the breed and the age of the breeder flock. \\nEgg candling\\nCandling of chicken eggs on the seventh and eighteenth days \\nof incubation is recommended for small poultry producers and \\ncommercial farms. Egg candling (using a torch or bright light in a \\ndark area) detects cracked and infertile eggs and those containing \\ndead embryos or bacterial or fungal rots; these eggs can then be \\nremoved from the incubator. Cracked and rotten eggs must not \\nbe allowed to remain in the incubator as they can explode and \\nresult in infection of the hatching chicks.\\nFumigation of incubators\\nThe effectiveness of formaldehyde gas in killing bacterial organ-\\nisms is based on the concentration of the gas, the exposure time, \\nthe temperature and the humidity of the incubator. The chemi-\\ncals potassium permanganate and formalin are mixed together to \\nrelease formaldehyde gas. This procedure has proved to be the \\nmost effective method of destroying bacterial organisms in the \\nhatchery. \\nHatched chicks\\nThe chicks hatch after 21 days of brooding or incubation. If the \\neggs have been hatched by a hen, she will immediately take care \\nof the chicks, but will typically remain on the nest until the major-\\nity of the eggs have hatched. If the chicks have been hatched in \\nan incubator, they are ready to be taken out of the hatcher when \\nmost of them are dry and fluffed up. Chicks will easily dehydrate \\nif left in the hatcher for too long. They have yolk reserves for \\nabout three days, but survival rates are increased if they are pro-\\nvided with food and water within 24 hours of hatching. Chicks \\nare normally removed from the hatchers within 24 hours of the \\nfirst chick hatching. The chicks should be held in an environment \\nthat prevents overheating or chilling. Temperatures should be in \\nthe range of 30 to 32 °C, and relative humidity in the range of 70 \\nto 75 percent. Adequate ventilation is vital at all times, to provide \\nthe chicks with a constant and uniform supply of fresh air.\\nVent and feather sexing\\nSexing of day-old chickens is not normally practised on village \\nfarms, but is an essential procedure in commercial operations \\nwith modern hybrids, particularly for layers, where the male chick \\nhas no commercial value. Broilers are also often sexed, but the \\nrequirement here is less important. There are two fundamentally \\ndifferent approaches to sexing: one identifies the sex of the day-\\nold chick by sex organ-related differences; and the other employs \\nsex-linked genes (Barnett et al., 2001). In the first approach, sex-\\ning can be done in any population using one of two methods: i) \\nvent sexing, which relies on visual identification of the sex organs \\nusing an endoscope inserted into the chick’s vent; and ii) cloa-\\nLarge-scale commercial incubator and hatcher'),\n",

Both of these pro-\\ncedures require extensive training. The second approach involves \\nfixing appropriate sex-linked feathering rate or colour genes in \\nthe parental lines (see website on Poultry genetics and breeding \\nin developing countries). In the progeny from such matings, male \\nchicks are either slow-feathering or white, and hatchery staff can \\nreadily distinguish them at hatch from their rapid-feathering or \\ncoloured-feathered female counterparts. \\nCulling chicks in the hatchery\\nCulling is conducted to reduce the potential for transferring dis-\\nease within flocks, to provide a uniform hatch of chicks for pro-\\nduction, and to reduce pain and suffering of sick and deformed \\nchicks. \\nThere are three methods for culling surplus or sick chicks (Bar-\\nnett et al., 2001):\\n• Cervical dislocation: The neck of the day-old chick is held \\nagainst a firm surface (e.g., the edge of a tabletop) and gen-\\ntle pressure from both thumbs is applied to dislocate it. This \\nmethod can be used on small farms.\\n• Gas stunning with carbon dioxide: The chicks are held in a con-\\ntainer covered with a lid or plastic. They are initially stunned \\nand then killed with longer exposure. A concentration of 55 \\npercent carbon dioxide in air is required to kill the chicks with \\ntwo minutes exposure time. \\n• High-speed macerators: Some larger hatcheries use these to \\nkill unwanted chicks and any live chicks in eggs that have failed \\nto hatch. \\nRemoval of claws and spurs \\nIn commercial operations, it is routine for male breeding birds to \\nhave the terminal segment of the inner toe removed, to prevent \\ndamage to female birds while mating. This is routinely done at \\nthe hatchery, although about 10 percent of chicks may have their \\nclaws removed on-farm. It is best to use a beak trimming machine \\nto cut and cauterize the wound, although scissors can also be \\nused. Males may also have their spurs removed, again preferably \\nusing a beak trimmer to cut and cauterize the wound (Barnett et \\nal., 2001). Sharp scissors can be used, but the wound is not cau-\\nterized, and there is a risk of excessive bleeding. This procedure \\nis necessary to prevent damage to birds when fighting. In village \\nfarms, the sharp points of the claws and spurs can be blunted \\nwith abrasive material. \\nBird identification\\nA small percentage of breeding birds require individual identifi-\\ncation. Methods used for small numbers of birds include either \\ncutting the skin between the toes (the webbing) with scissors or a \\nscalpel blade, or trimming the digits with sharp scissors or a beak \\ntrimming blade (Barnett et al., 2001). For larger numbers of birds \\nnumber-embossed wing bands or leg bands are necessary. Wing \\nbands are attached to the bird by passing the pin or sharp point \\nthrough the web of the wing. Leg bands are fastened around the \\nmetatarsus above the foot. \\nWing-bands can be applied at hatch, but leg-bands can not be \\napplied before about 12 weeks of age, due to rapid increase in \\nthe diameter of the leg up until about this age.\\nREFERENCES\\nBarnett, J.L., Glatz, P.C., Almond, A., Hemsworth, P.H. & Parkinson, \\nG.B. 2001.

The sooner they are pro-\\nvided with these and a warm area, the higher the rate of survival. \\nChicks must not be chilled or overheated at any time. \\nBROODING SYSTEMS\\nBroody hens \\nUnder natural conditions, the mother hen keeps the chicks warm \\nby allowing them to nestle under her feathers. The chicks follow \\nthe broody hen around and learn to forage and drink by watching \\nher behaviour. In small village poultry settings, hens can care for \\nup to 15 chicks. Ideally, chicks should be provided with a com-\\nmercial ration (Ahlers et al., 2009) or other feed for at least the \\nfirst two weeks, to improve the survival rate. \\nSpot brooding \\nFor small flocks of up to 20 chicks, a small enclosure in the poultry \\nhouse or a confined area can be set up. This can be made from \\ncardboard or timber, with a heat lamp suspended over the enclo-\\nsure to keep the chicks warm. When the chicks are provided with \\nan ideal temperature, they spread uniformly over the enclosure. \\nWhen chicks feel cold, they crowd under the heat source. If the \\npen is too warm, the chicks move away from the heat and pant \\nwith their wings spread out (Bell and Weaver, 2001). \\nFor larger flocks of up to 400 chicks, circular enclosures are set \\nup in the poultry house to retain them. These areas are usually \\nmade from Masonite or sheet metal, with a gas brooder suspend-\\ned over them to provide the required temperature (about 35\\xa0°C \\nimmediately under the brooder). There should be sufficient space \\nfor chicks to move away from the heat source. Temperatures in \\nthe outer part of the enclosure may be as low as 20\\xa0°C. \\nCommercial layers are often raised in growing cages (of up to \\n20 chicks/cage) with warm-room brooding, or with a heat source \\nover each cage in tropical climates. As the birds age, the stocking \\ndensity is reduced by moving chicks to other growing cages.\\n \\nWhole-house brooding \\nIn large commercial operations, the whole shed is maintained at \\na temperature of 30 to 32\\xa0°C both day and night, using forced-\\nair heaters. This can be achieved only if the shed is completely \\nsealed. As most developing countries are located in the tropics, \\nthere is usually no need for whole-house brooding. When this \\nsystem is used, the house temperature is lowered by about 2 to \\n3\\xa0°C per week until it reaches ambient temperature, provided this \\nis not below 18 °C. \\nChick feeders \\nAt one day old, feed for the chicks can be scattered on paper. \\nAfter three to four days, the paper can be removed, and chicks \\nprovided with feed in shallow feeders on the floor or cages.\\nChick drinkers \\nFor village chicks, drinkers can comprise bamboo sections or wa-\\nter bottles.

Typically, a village flock comprises ten to 12 layers with one \\nor two cockerels. Natural incubation by broody hens is common, \\nand egg fertility ranges from good to poor, depending on several \\nfactors. The decision to construct a house for chickens is often de-\\ntermined by the individual farmer’s access to materials, the avail-\\nability of space within the village, and other social and economic \\nfactors. However, the houses built are basically for night shelter, \\nand the breeding birds are left to scavenge for feed during the \\nday, thus they remain prone to predators even though shelters \\nare provided. \\nIn commercial and semi-commercial settings in developing \\ncountries, breeders are normally housed in naturally ventilated \\nhouses, with some additional lighting provided if electricity is \\navailable. The house is usually fitted with nest boxes, feeders and \\ndrinkers. Some large-scale operations use automatic feeding and \\negg collection systems.\\nBreeders in developing countries\\nA number of government, non-governmental and training or-\\nganizations have developed poultry breeding programmes for \\nproducing local chickens in developing countries. Some centres \\nhave imported improved commercial strains for crossing with the \\nlocal chickens to improve the meat and egg production of small-\\nholder poultry flocks. The breeding centres often distribute chicks \\nto farmers for use in their village farm operations. Larger com-\\nmercial integrated poultry franchises in developing countries nor-\\nmally import fertile eggs from commercial layer or broiler breeder \\nflocks. These eggs are set in large hatcheries, and hatched chicks \\nare either sold in small lots to village farmers or used in commer-\\ncial or semi-commercial operations to produce chicken meat and \\neggs for consumers in towns and cities. \\nThe poultry breeding facilities established in developing coun-\\ntries are normally small-scale. Ideally, the breeding flock should \\ncomprise females with good egg production, which are mated \\nwith active cockerels. A major issue is maintaining a supply of \\nfertile eggs. Young breeder flocks produce fewer fertile eggs than \\nthose at peak of lay, and fertility also tends to be lower in eggs \\nproduced by older breeders. Hatchability and the uniformity of \\nhatched chicks depend on management of the eggs produced by \\nthe breeders. In larger-scale operations, eggs should be collected \\nat least four times a day, handled carefully to prevent breakages, \\nand stored for no longer than seven days in a cool room at 15.5 \\nto 17 °C and relative humidity of 75 percent. Eggs on the floor or \\nthat are dirty should not be set. In small-scale village operations, \\nfarmers can clean dirty eggs with abrasive paper and make use of \\nall the eggs that are available.\\nBreeder chick management\\nChicks that are reared for use in a breeding programme should \\nbe kept separate from other birds in other age groups. Cock-\\nerels should also be grown separately from females, preferably \\nuntil five months of age. Generally, however, this approach is not \\npossible in village operations. Most chick rearing in hot-climate \\ndeveloping countries is carried out in naturally ventilated houses. \\nIn commercial operations, chicks scratch in the litter, creating un-\\neven litter levels, particularly around feeders and drinkers.

During the rearing period, birds can \\nremain in natural light in all seasons until artificial light stimulus \\nis given, normally at 20 or 21 weeks of age in meat breeders and \\nfrom 18 weeks in layer breeders. When extending the day length, \\nartificial light is provided at both the beginning and the end of the \\nnatural day-light period (Lewis and Morris, 2006).\\nWater management\\nBreeding birds in village systems are normally provided with wa-\\nter in open containers. Most commercial operations provide one \\nbell drinker per 80 birds, while nipple drinkers, which are a more \\nhygienic water delivery system, are provided for eight to ten birds \\nper nipple. Chickens normally drink between 1.6 and 2.0 times \\ntheir daily feed intake at 21 °C, in both ad libitum and control \\nfed flocks. At ambient temperatures higher than 30 °C, water \\nconsumption increases to more than twice the feed intake. High \\nwater consumption may indicate errors in feed formulation or \\nleaking drinker systems.\\nRelocating birds \\nIn village farming systems, breeder birds are often sold and trans-\\nferred to other village farms. In semi-commercial and commercial \\noperations, the age for transferring stock to other farms is deter-\\nmined mainly by the facilities available, the birds’ body weight \\nand the lighting programme. Transfer can be very stressful for the \\nbirds, and every effort should be made to ensure that it is car-\\nried out smoothly. It is best to transfer males a week earlier than \\nfemales, so they can adjust to their feeding system. The ratio of \\nmales to females is usually kept at about 1:10, and males should \\nbe healthy with no obvious skeletal defects.\\nProduction period\\nIn most developing countries, manual nesting systems that allow \\nabout four birds per nest are used. Young breeder males are of-\\nten added to an older flock to overcome the decline in fertility \\nthat usually occurs after peak egg production. Older males usu-\\nally undergo a decline in mating activity and a reduction in sperm \\nquality. \\nEgg weights\\nThere are considerable advantages in weighing a sample of eggs \\nto establish the trend in egg weight. Analysis of this trend pro-\\nvides a useful guide to breeder flock performance, and gives early \\nindication of problems. An egg weight that is too low could be \\nthe result of insufficient feed or water intake, high shed tempera-\\ntures or disease. If egg weight is too high, birds may be over-\\nweight or overfed. \\nEgg handling\\nOn larger breeder farms, eggs are collected two to three times a \\nday and kept in a cool place for three to four days before setting. If \\nheld for longer than seven days, they must be stored at 16 to 17\\xa0°C. \\nbirds will not be able to reach the feeders or drinkers if the lit-\\nter levels are not kept even. In large commercial operations in \\ncolder climates, the building should be pre-heated so the floor is \\nwarm and the air temperature close to 32 °C when the chicks are \\nplaced. If provided, lighting should be continuous for the first 48 \\nhours after the chicks arrive. \\nBeak trimming is practised where required to prevent injuri-\\nous pecking in the flock. Males often need re-trimming before \\nthey enter the breeding programme, to reduce the risk of pecking \\ndamage to the females during mating.\\nGrowth and production \\nDuring the rearing and growing period for breeder stock the \\nmajor objective is to control body weight, particularly to ensure \\nthat all the birds reach target weight-for-age uniformly. Body \\nweight targets are achieved by controlling feed allowances. Feed \\namounts during rearing are based on body weight and mainte-\\nnance; during lay, egg production and egg weight are also impor-\\ntant (Cobb-Vantress, 2008a).\\nIn meat and layer type birds, body weight uniformity is critical \\nduring the first six weeks of the breeders’ growth. Weekly body \\nweight increase is a good indicator of how successful the brood-\\ning has been. High-quality feed of appropriate particle size must \\nbe provided to obtain adequate feed intake in the first week. \\nCrop size is a good guide to how well the chicks are consuming \\nfeed and water. In developing countries, it is often difficult for \\nbreeder farms to meet the body weight standards set for devel-\\noped countries, owing to poor feed quality and the typically hot \\nenvironment.\\nDuring the period from six to 16 weeks, meat and layer breed-\\ners are usually put on a controlled feeding regime to keep their \\nbody weight on target. When the birds reach 16 weeks, they \\nare stimulated by providing up to an hour of additional artificial \\nlight per day, to promote sexual development. Particularly in layer \\nstrain breeder flocks, it is essential that the female parent achieves \\nsufficient body weight between 16 and 20 weeks of age, to maxi-\\nmize peak egg production and achieve consistent egg production \\nthroughout lay. Breeder flock egg production can be optimized \\nby appropriate feeding programmes that ensure that the pullets \\nhave uniform body weight. It is also important to keep the breed-\\ning flock body weight in check after maturity, by handling and \\nweighing birds often and adjusting the feeding levels as required. \\nLayer breeding stock should be fed daily from hatch to end of \\nlay, whereas for broiler breeders during the rearing phase, skip-a-\\nday feeding is often used because of the relatively severe restric-\\ntion that is needed to achieve the desired body weight in these \\nmuch heavier birds. Uniformity and bird welfare suffer if daily \\nfeeding is used, as the more timid birds miss out on their daily \\nallowance. On the alternate days, scratch grain is often provided \\nto reduce hunger. During the laying period, from about 21 weeks \\nof age, broiler breeders are typically fed a restricted amount daily. \\nThe restriction at this time is considerably less severe than it is dur-\\ning the rearing period. Separate-sex feeding is normally practised \\nduring the laying period, with males having no access to females’ \\nfeed, and vice versa. This has more to do with diet composition \\nthan quantity, as males have a far lower calcium requirement than \\nfemales.'),\n",

This is \\ndifficult to achieve in village operations, but commercial systems \\ncan do so in a number of ways, through whole-house brooding, \\nor partial house brooding to conserve heat and reduce energy \\ncosts (Cobb-Vantress, 2008). Correct temperatures are more eas-\\nily maintained in a small area. Ventilation also needs to be consid-\\nered, as it distributes heat to the birds and helps maintain good \\nair quality in the brooding area. Chicks are more susceptible to \\npoor air quality than older birds are. High ammonia levels have \\nbeen shown to reduce the body weight gains of seven-day chicks \\nby 20 percent. \\nIn semi-commercial and large-scale operations, lights are need-\\ned along the brooding area above the heat source in the house, \\nto attract chicks to the feed and water. These lights should be \\nused during the first five days after the chicks arrive, after which \\nbackground lights should be gradually increased, to reach normal \\nlighting by the tenth day.\\nA well-insulated roof reduces solar heat penetration into the \\nhouse on warm days, thus decreasing the heat load on the birds. \\nIn village settings, many farmers use discarded iron for roofing, \\nbut local leaf material made into thatch is preferable (especially in \\ntropical countries), as it insulates the building from extreme heat. \\nIn cold weather, a well-insulated roof reduces heat loss and the \\nenergy consumption needed to maintain the correct environment \\nfor broiler chicks during the brooding phase. In poorly insulated \\nbuildings, an area can be set up inside the shed where tempera-\\nture fluctuations can be minimized by using curtains and a false \\nceiling running from eave to eave, to reduce heat loss and make \\ntemperature control easier. \\nStocking density\\nIt is essential that meat birds have adequate room, whether they \\nare housed in small groups on village farms or in larger semi-\\ncommercial or commercial sheds. Lack of space can lead to leg \\nproblems, injuries and increased mortality (Sainsbury, 1988). As \\nthey approach market weight, an approximate maximum stock-\\ning density for fully confined birds on deep litter is 30 kg of bird \\nper square metre of floor area. \\nDrinker management\\nProviding clean, cool water is critical in broiler production. With-\\nout adequate water intake, feed consumption will decline and \\nbird growth will be depressed. There are many types of drinkers; \\nin high temperature conditions, drinkers that allow water circula-\\ntion and cooling are best. In small-scale operations, it is important \\nto keep drinkers topped up, to clean and refill them daily, and to \\nlocate them in a cool part of the pen or cage, away from any heat \\nsource or the sun’s rays. \\nFeeding management \\nIf feeder space is insufficient, growth rates will be reduced and \\nuniformity will be compromised. Feed distribution and the prox-\\nimity of the feeder to the birds are essential for achieving opti-\\nmum feed consumption rates. In tropical developing countries, \\nthe main factor reducing feed consumption is high temperatures. \\nFeed should be withheld at the hottest time of the day, to prevent \\nheat stress and the resultant mortality.

However, they need \\nmore careful management than village chicks, which are better \\nable to cope with temperature fluctuations. Prior to chick arrival, \\nit is important to clean and disinfect the cages or the floor brood-\\ning area. The brooders should be set up the day before delivery, at \\n34 to 36 °C for cage brooding or 35 to 36 °C for floor brooding \\n(Hyline International, 2009). Drinkers need to be full or the drink-\\ning system in operation, to encourage birds to drink. If nipple \\ndrinkers are used, the water pressure should be reduced so that \\nbirds can see the drop of water hanging on the drinker. Feed \\nshould be placed on paper if birds are reared in cages. Feeders \\non the floor should be filled and kept under high light intensity \\nfor 20 to 22 hours per day for the first week, to attract the birds.\\nGrowing period management\\nThe first 17 weeks of a pullet’s life are critical. Careful manage-\\nment during this period will allow the bird to meet her perfor-\\nmance potential (Bell and Weaver, 2001). Although it is not al-\\nways possible to grow pullets in strict isolation from older birds on \\nvillage farms, it is recommended on semi-commercial and com-\\nmercial farms. During the first six weeks, it is important to provide \\nfeed at least twice a day. After five weeks, feed consumption \\nand body weights must be checked. It is good practice to weigh \\n100 pullets a week during the growing period, beginning at five \\nweeks of age. Pullets should be moved to cages or the laying \\nhouse at 16 weeks of age, before the onset of sexual maturity.\\nFloor systems management\\nPerches should be provided in the growing and laying house en-\\nvironment. This allows the birds to develop their leg and flight \\nmuscles, which is essential for their full utilization of the laying \\nhouse environment. Perches reduce the social stress of birds in-\\nteracting on the floor, by providing them with a place to roost \\nand get away from other birds in the flock. It is also desirable that \\nbirds have access to the same type of feeder and water system in \\nthe growing house as they will have in the laying house, although \\nthis is not always possible. \\nBirds also need to adapt to the presence of humans, and walk-\\ning through a poultry house regularly will socialize them. In the \\nlaying period, the lighting times need to be synchronized with \\nthose in the rearing facility. When birds are placed in the laying \\nhouse they need to be encouraged to explore the nest boxes. \\nCommercial-scale operations can do this with nest lights to train \\nthe birds to use the nests. \\nRearing layer pullets in multiple-bird wire cages \\nLarge-scale modern layer barn (above) and sector 2 layer production unit \\n(Egypt, below) \\nPhoto Credit: Olaf Thieme\\nPhoto Credit: Phil Glatz\\nPhoto Credit: Robert Pym'),\n",

An effective lighting pro-\\ngramme for houses where outside daylight can be excluded in-\\nvolves giving pullets 20 to 22 hours of light a day at 30 lux in the \\nfirst week, reducing this to 20 hours at 5 lux in the second week, \\nand then reducing the photoperiod over the following weeks, to \\nreach ten to 12 hours by seven to nine weeks of age. \\nIn open-sided houses, lighting is increased to the longest natu-\\nral day length from six to 17 weeks of age. It is useful to provide \\nlight stimulation when the body weight of commercial hybrids \\nreaches about 1.5 kg. Light can be increased by 15 to 30 minutes \\nper week, until 16 hours of light a day is reached. It is critical \\nthat light intensity in housing is increased to 10 to 30 lux. There \\nshould be no decrease in day length or light intensity for adult \\nlayers. In village poultry production, most birds are exposed to a \\nnatural day length, and farmers do not have lighting available to \\nstimulate egg production in village hens.\\nIn developing countries, layers are not generally reared or kept \\nin light-controlled housing. \\nThe onset of sexual maturity or egg production depends on \\nreaching the minimum chronological age and a minimum body \\nweight (usually about 1.5 kg in commercial hybrids), as well as \\nhaving adequate nutrient intake to support production, and a \\nconstant or increasing day length of at least 12 hours.\\nAn optional lighting technique for promoting increased feed \\nconsumption is night lighting. This involves turning the lights on \\nfor one hour in the middle of the dark period, to allow the birds \\nto feed. \\nEgg size management\\nEgg size is largely genetically determined, but can be manipulated \\nby lighting and feeding programmes. The larger the body weight \\nat maturity, the larger the hen’s eggs will be for her entire life. Egg \\nweight is thus generally a reasonable indicator of body weight, \\nbut in general the earlier a flock begins production, the smaller \\nthe egg size will be, and the later the onset of egg production, \\nthe larger the egg size. Lighting programmes can be manipulated \\nto influence rate of maturity (Bell and Weaver, 2001). A decreas-\\ning light pattern continuing past ten weeks of age delays maturity \\nand increases average egg size. Egg size is greatly affected by the \\nintake of energy, total fat, crude protein, methionine and cystine \\nSemi-intensive sector 3 type layer production (Afghanistan)\\nPhoto Credit: Olaf Thieme\\nPhoto Credit: Robert Pym'),\n",

However, the increasing density of human settlements has \\nresulted in a decrease in the scavenging feed resource base (SFRB) \\nin urban and peri-urban areas. This, combined with government \\naction associated with the risks of disease transfer, particularly \\nhighly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), to humans and com-\\nmercial poultry, is leading to a steady reduction in the number of \\nperi-urban scavenging flocks of family poultry in many countries, \\nand the large majority of these flocks are now located in rural \\nregions.\\nSmall (five to 30-bird) family-owned flocks, usually of indig-\\nenous breed or crossbred birds, are given household food scraps \\nand sometimes small amounts of grain or grain by-products, \\nand spend much of their time during daylight hours scavenging \\naround the house and yard for seeds, insects, snails, earthworms, \\ngrass, shoots, fallen fruit, frogs, etc., depending on the local envi-\\nronment and season. Household scraps and supplementary grain \\ntypically comprise a significant proportion of the energy intake of \\nthese birds, particularly in the dry season (see website on Poultry \\nfeed availability and nutrition in developing countries). Birds are \\nnot usually provided with water, so have to obtain it from the \\nenvironment. This can have a marked impact on their health and \\nproductivity, particularly in the dry season.\\nHousing\\nOne of the defining features of the semi-scavenging production \\nsystem is the lack of management compared with most other \\nproduction systems (Gueye, 2000). The birds are very much on \\ntheir own, and their productivity is usually quite limited by the \\ntypically meagre nutritional inputs they receive. Housing is mostly \\nlimited to some form of enclosure for the birds at night, to protect \\nthem from predation, theft and environmental exposure, and to \\nprovide a site for supplementary feeding. Enclosures also make \\nit possible to catch birds for vaccination, although this is by no \\nmeans a regular or common practice with semi-scavenging poul-\\ntry. Birds’ night shelters may be a separate structure, under the \\nhuman dwelling, or even within their owner’s home. However, \\nit is not unusual for birds to be provided with no shelter, and to \\nroost in trees at night. Where a separate structure is available, it is \\nusually a simple construction made from local materials.\\nIndigenous breed birds are seldom reared or housed in confine-\\nment, as their productivity (egg and meat production), even un-\\nder good-quality ad libitum feeding, is insufficient to warrant the \\ncost of this level of management. Confinement rearing may be \\njustified for some higher-producing indigenous strains or cross-\\nbreeds, where there is a niche market for their eggs or meat. Con-\\nversely, improved breed/strain commercial birds cannot perform \\nat their genetic potential under semi-scavenging management \\nconditions, so are not suitable for this form of production. The \\nsurvival of commercial genotypes (particularly broilers) is severely \\ncompromised under scavenging systems.\\nHousehold flock of scavenging chickens provided with nigh-time shelter \\nunder the human dwelling (Myanmar)\\nSemi-scavenging poultry production (Lao PDR)\\nPhoto Credit: Viengsavanh Phimphachanhvongsod\\nPhoto Credit: Joerg Henning'),\n",

Ad-\\nvances in knowledge and technology over recent decades favour \\nthe growth and intensification of poultry production in develop-\\ning countries where there are increasing human populations and \\neconomic constraints. Issues related to the environment, human \\nhealth and the quality of life for people living near to and distant \\nfrom poultry production operations make waste management a \\ncritical consideration for the long-term growth and sustainability \\nof poultry production in larger bird facilities located near urban \\nand peri-urban areas, as well as for smaller commercial systems \\nassociated with live bird markets, and for village and backyard \\nflocks located in rural areas. \\nThese information notes focus primarily on medium-sized to \\nlarge intensive poultry production units, but many of the princi-\\nples apply to smaller operations, including small family scaveng-\\ning flocks. Fundamental knowledge of the environmental and \\nhealth issues associated with poultry waste management will \\nserve both small and large poultry producers now and in the fu-\\nture, as the intensification of poultry production continues to gain \\nfavour globally. \\nPotential pollutants and issues related to \\npoultry production\\nThe production of poultry results in: hatchery wastes, manure \\n(bird excrement), litter (bedding materials such as sawdust, wood \\nshavings, straw and peanut or rice hulls), and on-farm mortalities. \\nThe processing of poultry results in additional waste materials, \\nincluding offal (feathers, entrails and organs of slaughtered birds), \\nprocessing wastewater and biosolids. Most of these by-products \\ncan provide organic and inorganic nutrients that are of value if \\nmanaged and recycled properly, regardless of flock size. However, \\nthey also give rise to potential environmental and human health \\nconcerns as the sources of elements, compounds (including veter-\\ninary pharmaceuticals), vectors for insects and vermin, and patho-\\ngenic microorganisms. With the probable exception of veterinary \\npharmaceuticals, these factors are also relevant to small flocks, \\nincluding small family flocks that may be partially housed in con-\\ntainment structures.\\nManaging these poultry by-products as potential pollutants \\ncentres on water and air quality concerns, and in some cases on \\nsoil quality (FAO, 2008; Nahm and Nahm, 2004; Williams, Barker \\nand Sims, 1999). Specific concerns that are well documented \\ninclude degradation of nearby surface and/or groundwater, re-\\nsulting from increased loading of nutrients such as nitrogen and \\nphosphorus (and potassium in some locations). Air quality issues \\nare less well understood and include the fate and effect of am-\\nmonia, hydrogen sulphide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) \\nand dust particulates emitted from poultry production facilities. \\nGreenhouse gas emissions and health effects associated with nui-\\nsance odorants are also emerging and/or relevant issues, owing \\nto global climate change and increasing human populations in \\nclose proximity to poultry operations, respectively. \\nWater and soil impacts of potential pollutants from \\npoultry production\\nMost poultry manure and litter are applied to land near poul-\\ntry production farms. With few exceptions, this is the preferred \\npractice in developing countries and elsewhere. Such land man-\\nagement of poultry by-products brings the risk of surface and \\ngroundwater contamination from potential pollutants contained \\nin the manure and litter. Its value depends on several factors, in-\\ncluding the agronomic potential of the receiving crop(s) to utilize \\nthe waste nutrients, the receiving soil type and specific geological \\nHousing conditions that promote good ventilation, non leaking waters \\nand drier manure and litter results in healthier birds and manure of \\nbetter nutrient value for crop fertilizer. \\nPhoto Credit: John T.

This type of \\nwaste operation is more common with swine or dairy livestock \\nthan poultry, but may occur in some locations with layer opera-\\ntions. Under open-air fermentation, hydrogen sulphide and VOCs \\ncan be emitted into the atmosphere as pollutants, and can also \\nbe components of nuisance odour. Hydrogen sulphide can be \\ndangerous to humans at certain concentrations. Donham and \\nThelin (2006) note that agitation of manure slurry in pits beneath \\nanimals can result in rapid elevation of ambient hydrogen sul-\\nphide to lethal concentrations, within seconds. The World Health \\nOrganization (WHO, 2000) notes an air quality guideline for hy-\\ndrogen sulphide of 0.15 mg/m3 averaged over a 24-hour period. \\nParticulate matter (or dust) is an aerial pollutant of more con-\\ncern than hydrogen sulphide and VOCs. It occurs in typical poul-\\ntry operations where appreciable numbers of birds are confined. \\nDust emissions can contain dried fecal matter and may include \\nbacteria, endotoxins, moulds, mites and insect parts (Clark, Ry-\\nlander and Larsson, 1983). Dust emissions from housing facili-\\nties are highly variable, depending on the climate, building de-\\nsign, feed consistency (dry or pellet) and control mechanisms for \\npreventing large dust particles from leaving the area near the \\nbuilding – in recent years, considerable progress has been made \\nin developing low-cost dust barriers to prevent dust dispersion \\n(Poultry Science Association, 2009). Fine particulate matter (e.g., \\nPM-fine) resulting from the conversion of ammonia gas in the \\natmosphere into ammonium salts can have greater consequences \\nfor human health, and is less likely to be mitigated by dust barrier \\napproaches for preventing larger dust particles. This is another \\nof the factors that make aerial ammonia emissions so important.\\nClimatic conditions play a very significant role in the impacts \\nfrom aerial poultry pollutants, regardless of flock size. For ex-\\nample, excessively dry conditions, especially in litter, result in in-\\ncreased respiratory conditions affecting birds’ productivity, while \\nconditions of the land being utilized, the distance to nearby sur-\\nface and groundwaters, the amount of vegetated areas (riparian \\nbuffers) adjacent to nearby surface waters, and the climate. Nutri-\\nent loading and build-up within a geological region is ecologically \\nimportant and has an impact on the diversity and productivity of \\nessential, naturally occurring living organisms within that region \\n(Gundersen, 1992). The issue is increasingly complex owing to \\nthe trend for producing meat and eggs under intensified systems \\nthat require grain to be imported into production regions to meet \\nfeedstock requirements. This often leads to nutrient imbalances, \\nand adverse environmental or health effects can occur when land \\napplication of the nutrients exceeds crop utilization potential, or \\nif poor management results in nutrient loss due to soil erosion or \\nsurface runoff during rainfall. Surface or groundwater contami-\\nnation by manure nutrients and pathogens is especially serious if \\ndrinking-water supplies are affected.\\nThe primary nutrients of concern are nitrogen and phosphorus. \\nThe nitrogen compounds contained in manure and litter are very \\ndynamic and can be removed from land by uptake of the receiv-\\ning crop harvest or by conversion to gases that volatilize into the \\natmosphere in the form of ammonia, nitrous oxides or harmless \\ndi-nitrogen. Nitrogen is also very mobile in soil, and may be trans-\\nported to groundwater and/or nearby surface waters. Unlike ni-\\ntrogen, phosphorus in manure and litter is very immobile, but can \\nleach into shallow groundwater or laterally transport to surface \\nwaters via erosion or subsurface runoff under certain climatic, soil \\nand phosphorus concentration conditions. Nitrogen in the form \\nof nitrates in drinking-water can cause adverse health effects; and \\nboth nitrogen and phosphorus in certain concentrations and envi-\\nronmental conditions can result in degradation of surface waters.\\nRegarding nutrient loading from poultry manure and litter, the \\nfocus is mainly on nitrogen and phosphorus, but certain metals \\nsuch as copper and zinc, which may also be contained in poultry \\nexcreta, should also be considered when planning long-term sus-\\ntainable nutrient balance in soils receiving poultry waste. In cer-\\ntain soil conditions, a build-up of these metals can be detrimental \\n(toxic) for some crops (Zublena, 1994).\\nAir quality impacts of potential pollutants from poultry \\nproduction\\nAir quality can be affected by aerial emissions of pollutants from \\npoultry production facilities. Ammonia emitted into the atmos-\\nphere is arguably the most environmentally significant aerial pol-\\nlutant associated with poultry production (FAO, 2006). The trans-\\nport and fate of ammonia once it is emitted into the atmosphere \\nare not well understood, but its presence in high concentrations \\ncan trigger environmental effects that have impacts on local eco-\\nsystems and human health. As such, consideration of the envi-\\nronmental effects on airsheds and watersheds of nutrient loading \\nfrom poultry production is important for long-term sustainabil-\\nity. Ammonia from poultry operations is derived from nitrogen, \\nwhich is an essential component of dietary protein, amino acids \\nand other biomolecules necessary for life. However, dietary ni-\\ntrogen not converted into meat, eggs or other tissue is excreted \\nin the form of organic nitrogen, which is rapidly converted into \\nammonia under most, but not all, poultry production practices. \\nThe amount of ammonia actually emitted into the atmosphere \\ndepends on multiple variables, including climate, poultry housing \\nPhoto Credit: John T.

On \\na global scale, much research has been conducted on ways of re-\\ncovering nutrients and value-added organic products from animal \\nwastes, to improve agricultural efficiency and mitigate environ-\\nmental impacts in their regions. Many systems and approaches \\ncan be successful if properly operated and maintained.\\nLand application of crop nutrients\\nGlobally, poultry manure or litter has been applied to land to en-\\nhance crop production for centuries. When properly managed, \\nthis is an effective and beneficial option. Environmental pollution \\noccurs when manure or litter is applied to the land in excess of \\nthe receiving crop’s capacity to utilize the nutrients. Other factors \\nthat influence the environmental fate of the manure and litter \\napplied include methods of collecting, storing, handling, treating, \\ntransporting and applying the waste by-products to the receiv-\\ning land. For example, with non-liquid-flush systems, the poultry \\nhousing and manure storage area should be designed so that the \\nmanure and litter are kept as dry as possible, to minimize aerial \\nemissions of gases and assist fly control. Manure and litter stor-\\nage should be planned to prevent contact with rainfall or rain \\nrunoff. Land application should be based on the agronomic up-\\ntake of the receiving crop, accurate analysis of the nutrients con-\\ntained in the manure (particularly nitrogen, phosphorus, copper \\nand zinc) and properly calibrated application methods; it should \\nbe avoided when the land is frozen or excessively wet. Land ap-\\nplication methods that incorporate the manure or litter directly \\ninto the soil minimize odour and gas emissions and surface run-\\noff. These principles also apply to small family operations, whose \\nsanitation will be improved by periodically removing manure or \\nlitter from areas where just a few birds are housed, and by stor-\\ning, composting and/or land-applying the product at least 100 m \\nfrom where the live birds are kept.\\nComposting is a natural aerobic biological process to break-\\ndown organic matter, which provides a practical and economical-\\nly feasible method for stabilizing poultry manure and litter before \\nland application (Carr, 1994). Correctly managed composting \\neffectively binds nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in \\norganic forms, and reduces pathogens, insect eggs and weed \\nseed owing to the heat generated during the biological process-\\ning. Composting can also reduce nuisance odour emissions from \\npoultry waste storage and treatment areas. A variety of compost-\\ning approaches, from very simple to more complex automated \\nsystems, are available for both large and small poultry producers.\\nIn areas where manure or litter is land-applied near streams or \\nsurface waters, an exceptionally simple and effective approach \\nfor mitigating surface runoff or the subsurface flow of potential \\nharmful nutrients is to maintain a natural riparian buffer next to \\nthe water resources (Wenger, 1999). Riparian buffers may com-\\nprise native grasses, shrubs or trees, or a combination of these. \\nThe width and make-up of a riparian buffer are specific to its \\nlocation, and the width of the buffer from the stream edge de-\\ntermines its effectiveness. Natural grass buffers of approximately \\n10 m wide have been shown to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus \\nfrom field surface runoff by approximately 25 percent, while com-\\nbined grass and tree buffers are much more effective. This prac-\\ntice is a documented inexpensive natural method of protecting \\nwater resources from the nutrients and pathogenic microorgan-\\nisms contained in nearby land-applied poultry manure or litter.\\nAnimal refeeding \\nScientific research has documented that nutrients and energy \\nfrom poultry waste by-products, including manure and litter, can \\nbe safely recycled as a component of livestock and poultry diets \\nwhen pathogens are neutralized (McCaskey, 1995). Poultry litter \\nhas been estimated to be as much as three times more valuable \\nas a feedstuff than as a fertilizer for crop nutrients. However, such \\npractices depend on regional regulations and public perceptions \\nof the concept of animals’ consumption of fecal material, regard-\\nless of its documented value and safety. If practised, caution is es-\\nsential. For example, copper toxicity can result when litter is fed to \\nsheep. Incorrectly processed poultry waste can contain potentially \\npathogenic microorganisms, including Salmonella. Depending on \\nenvironmental conditions and the global region of production, \\nantibiotics, arsenicals and mycotoxins can also be present in poul-\\ntry manures and litters.\\nThe refeeding of poultry processing by-products is a common \\nand acceptable practice in most, but not all, cultures. Advances \\nin the treatment and processing of feathers and offal to produce \\nvalue-added feed ingredients are making this practice more at-\\ntractive in some regions, especially with the recent increases for \\nfeeds derived from grains.\\nBioenergy production\\nPoultry manure and litter contain organic matter that can be con-\\nverted into bioenergy under certain processing technologies.

Estimates of the manure excreted by 1 000 birds per \\nday (based on average daily live weights during the birds’ produc-\\ntion cycle) are approximately 120 kg for layer chickens, 80 kg for \\nmeat chickens, 200 to 350 kg for turkeys (grower females and \\ngrower heavy males, respectively), and 150 kg for ducks (Collins \\net al., 1999; Williams, Barker and Sims, 1999). Extrapolations can \\nbe calculated to give general estimates for the number of birds in \\na given operation.\\nAfter excretion, the quantity of manure requiring management \\ndepends on factors such as water content, whether the manure is \\nstored in a location where rainfall collects, or whether it is mixed \\nwith materials such as straw, wood shavings or rice hulls, as is \\ntypical in meat bird housing. Estimates of the litter produced by \\n1\\xa0 000 meat birds produced for market range from 1.1 to 2.4 \\ntonnes for chickens, 7.3 to 12.7 tonnes for turkeys (grower fe-\\nmales and grower heavy males, respectively), and 3.9 tonnes for \\nducks (Collins et al., 1999; Williams, Barker and Sims, 1999). \\nAgain, extrapolations can be calculated to give general estimates \\nfor the number of birds in a given operation. However, these val-\\nues can be greatly influenced by management practices, such as \\nwhether fresh litter is added to existing litter after each growing \\ncycle of birds, or a portion of the manure “cake” is removed from \\nthe existing litter prior to adding fresh litter.\\nManure nutrients\\nThe scientific literature contains reliable and comprehensive in-\\nformation based on average values from a wide database, on the \\nchemical (nutrient) and physical composition of manures and lit-\\nter (see the references at the end of this note). Estimates of some \\nenvironmentally important nutrients in manure are given in Table \\n1. They can vary according to the composition of ingredients in \\nthe birds’ feed, and especially if the birds scavenge for all or part \\nof their diet. Although the estimated manure weight as excreted \\nmay not vary significantly by bird type, it is essential that spe-\\ncific manure nutrient characteristics and concentrations be deter-\\nmined by reliable sampling and testing. \\nManure and litter storage conditions influence some nutrient \\nconcentrations; for example, appreciable ammonia may be lost \\nto the atmosphere from manure or litter that is stored in areas \\nexposed to rain or groundwater.

Dust from poultry operations can include feed \\ndust, manure, feather dust, bacteria, mould spores, endotoxins, \\ninsects, insect parts and ammonia absorbed in dust. The transport \\nof aerosols can be an important consideration when establishing \\nthe separation distances between poultry production facilities to \\nreduce the risk of aerial transmission of communicable disease-\\ntransmitting microorganisms. Depending on their concentration, \\naerosol pollutants can be harmful to the respiratory health of \\nbirds within the containment areas, and may also be harmful to \\nthe health of workers or inhabitants living close to poultry pro-\\nduction areas. However, at the international level, comprehensive \\nstudies regarding the human health effects of aerosols from poul-\\ntry operations are lacking. \\nAerial-transported ammonia can affect local and distant eco-\\nsystems, depending on the ecological sensitivity of the water \\nsource(s) into which the ammonia is deposited as dry or wet fall. \\nAerosol ammonia is also a precursor gas for ambient particulate \\nmatter, under certain atmospheric conditions, and there is evi-\\ndence of negative human health effects from exposure to particu-\\nlate matter, especially fine particulate matter. \\nRegardless of their location or size, existing and new poultry \\nproduction operations should consider mitigating the risks associ-\\nated with aerosol emissions to ensure the future sustainability of \\npoultry production practices.\\nSource and emission of aerosols\\nEven under the best management conditions, poultry production \\ncan be a source of aerosol contaminants, including gases, odour, \\ndust and microorganisms. These gaseous compounds and living \\norganisms are generated from natural biological processes associ-\\nated with poultry manure decomposition soon after the manure \\nis produced, during manure and litter storage and treatment, and \\nduring application of the manure or litter to fertilize cropland. Par-\\nticulate matter as dust can originate from both feed and the birds. \\nHowever, the generation rate of these gases, microorganisms and \\nparticulates is highly variable, depending on the weather, the spe-\\ncies and age of the birds, housing conditions, and the manure \\nhandling system, feed type and management system(s) used. \\nOnce aerosol pollutants are generated, they can be emitted \\nfrom their sources through the production unit’s ventilation sys-\\ntem, which is characteristic of larger units, or by natural weather-\\nsourced ventilation, in smaller or naturally ventilated larger units. \\nThe emission rates of the pollutants depend on many factors in-\\ncluding time of year and day, temperature, humidity, wind speed \\nand other weather conditions, ventilation rates, housing type, \\nand manure properties and characteristics – for example, dryer \\nmanure and litter result in more particulate emission, while moist \\nconditions are likely to result in increased emission of ammonia. It \\nis extremely difficult to determine specific aerosol emission rates \\nfrom point sources such as poultry housing units, manure or litter \\nstorage areas, and during application to cropland, and definitive \\ninformation is lacking. This remains a very active area of research \\nin many parts of the world.\\nEffects of aerosol pollution\\nAerosol emissions can compromise bird health and productivity \\n(feed conversion, meat and egg yield). Aerosol emissions from \\npoultry operations can transmit communicable diseases to neigh-\\nbouring poultry flocks; scientific evidence shows that some path-\\nogenic microorganisms can remain viable and be transported for \\nappreciable distances (from 50 to more than 500 m) in ambient \\nair. Evidence also shows that the health of farm workers can be \\naffected by day-to-day exposure to aerosols. Primary effects are \\non respiratory function, which is not surprising considering the \\ncomposition of typical aerosol pollutants associated with poultry \\nproduction (ammonia, dust, microorganisms and endotoxins). \\nClean housing surfaces, good ventilation and good management will \\nreduce risks caused by bio-aerosols in poultry houses.\\nPhoto Credit: John T.

There is increased attention to and awareness of the \\nenvironmental and human health impacts – real or perceived – of \\nanimal agriculture. The demand for poultry meat and eggs will \\nlikely increase in the next decades, but in most parts of the world, \\nthe proportion of the population participating in day-to-day on-\\nfarm activities is steadily decreasing – a trend that is likely to con-\\ntinue. Although small backyard and scavenging poultry flocks are \\nbecoming more popular in some urban areas of developed coun-\\ntries, global demand for production and economic efficiency are \\nlikely to result in larger concentrated production farms continuing \\nto be more prevalent in most regions. \\nSmall and scavenging flocks controlled by cooperatives, villag-\\ners and families are prevalent in rural areas of some developing \\ncountries, where they contribute to poverty alleviation and food \\nsecurity. However, as larger production farms become more com-\\nmon in these countries, siting issues regarding biosecurity will \\nhave an impact on small-scale village and family flocks, possibly \\nleading to conflict if proper management practices are not exer-\\ncised. The sustainability and potential expansion of any poultry \\nproduction or processing operation are affected by its location, \\nespecially in the long term. This is particularly true of operations \\nlocated near urban or peri-urban areas. These factors demand \\ncareful planning of the location and siting of poultry production \\nunits. Failure to take such planning considerations into account \\nwhen constructing new and larger facilities may result in costly \\nchanges or management expenditures in the future. \\nPlanning considerations\\nInfrastructure, water, regulatory requirements and \\npermits\\nA first step in planning the location of any poultry unit includes \\nassessing the existing infrastructure support, especially for larger \\nunits; for example, does the location have adequate roadways \\nand utilities to support the transport of inputs and outputs and \\nensure the unit’s energy requirements? The adequacy and supply \\nof fresh and safe water to support the unit’s production and op-\\nerational needs should also be determined. The available labour \\nforce should be considered:  larger farms need dependable work-\\ners, who should – as far as possible – live in areas without poten-\\ntial disease reservoir birds (village and scavenging flocks). The reg-\\nulatory requirements for the region must be accurately assessed. \\nThese may involve setback stipulations from property lines, water \\nsources, residences, roadways, schools and churches; develop-\\nment and implementation of comprehensive nutrient manage-\\nment plans that apply to the watershed or airshed in which the \\nunit will be located; and acquisition of necessary permits. \\nNear neighbour assessment\\nThe potential for affecting neighbours or neighbourhoods with \\nnuisance emissions (primarily odour) and/or flies cannot be ig-\\nnored. The management and operational efficiency of any opera-\\ntion can be negatively affected if sufficient time and effort are not \\ngiven to resolving conflicts resulting from nuisance complaints \\nand potential litigation, even if all regulatory and permit require-\\nments are met. With few exceptions, the transport of potential \\npollutants (by surface runoff, leaching into the groundwater, or \\naerial emissions of volatile compounds or dust particulates) from \\npoultry production or processing is not limited to the bounda-\\nries of the property on which the unit is located; neither is com-\\nmunicable disease transmission. Consideration should be given \\nto biosecure zones, especially in developing countries, regarding \\nseparation distances from areas containing water sources sup-\\nporting water fowl, nomadic ducks or village birds, which are all \\npotential carriers of avian influenza and other diseases. Serious \\nconsideration must also be given to communication and interac-\\nThis poultry facility has good topography for rain drainage away from \\nthe building, utilities, fencing for bio-security, and appears to be located \\naway from nearby residents– all good siting practices.\\nLocation, siting and concentration of  \\npoultry units\\nCharles Michael Williams, North Carolina State University, Department of Poultry Science, Raleigh NC, United States of \\nAmerica\\nPhoto Credit: John T.

This is also true of very \\nsmall-scale processing facilities and village and home (backyard) \\nflock operations. The World Bank Group (2007) provides detailed \\nand useful environmental health and safety guidelines for all steps \\nof poultry processing, from the reception of live birds, through \\nslaughter and evisceration, to simple waste processing. This infor-\\nmation note focuses on the utilization of organic solids, of which \\nan estimated 1 million tonnes are generated every year world-\\nwide. As for poultry production wastes (manure and litter), these \\norganic solids should be considered both potential resources and \\npotential environmental pollutants, depending on how they are \\nprocessed and managed. Similarly, the siting of slaughterhouses, \\nlike that of production facilities, should give careful consideration \\nto biosecurity and near neighbour issues. The size of the slaughter \\nfacility also has implications for environmental and food safety \\npractices and issues – again, the size issue is similar for poultry \\nproduction facilities. \\nThe treatment and environmental fate of processing wastewa-\\nter and organic solid wastes should be based on site-specific re-\\nquirements, regulations and the location of the slaughterhouse. \\nFor example, some regions have very specific requirements for \\nthe organic and inorganic wastes that are discharged into surface \\nwaters following treatment, and some have restrictions or regula-\\ntions for the processed solids destined for animal feed compo-\\nnents. When possible, the treatment of solid waste should aim \\nto produce value-added sellable by-products, such as animal or \\naquaculture feed components, energy (through biogas produc-\\ntion) and agricultural fertilizer. For very small or backyard flock \\noperations, slaughter is likely to generate very small quantities of \\nsolid wastes, and the management of these wastes should focus \\nmore on proper disposal and recycling (burial or composting) re-\\ngarding biosecurity and human health issues. \\nComposition, characterization and \\nreprocessing of slaughterhouse solids \\nPoultry carcass yields are typically about 70 to 75 percent of the \\nlive bird weight; the quantity of potentially sellable solid waste \\ndepends on the efficiency of the processing methods and the \\nhealth of the birds prior to processing. \\nBlood is approximately 2 percent of the live bird weight, and a \\nsource of highly concentrated protein when filtered and dried to \\nproduce blood meal. During slaughter, blood is typically collected \\nseparately from the other viscera and, depending on cooling con-\\nditions and storage time prior to further processing, may require \\nchemicals to prevent coagulation. Processed blood meal can be \\nused in animal and fish feed as well as fertilizer.\\nFeathers comprise approximately 7 to 10 percent of the live \\nbird weight and are another source of protein (75 to 90 percent \\ncrude protein), although the utilization value of feathers as an \\nanimal feed component depends on further processing methods \\n(e.g., high-pressure cooking at > 100 OC or enzymatic treatment) \\nto improve digestibility. Processed feathers can also be used for \\nbedding, clothing and other niche market items for humans. \\nThe head, feet (recovered for human consumption in some \\nregions) and inedible viscera make up the remainder of slaugh-\\nterhouse solids. Following further processing by methods such \\nas conventional rendering at specified temperatures and pres-\\nsures, depending on the intended fate and risk factor of the ma-\\nterial, sellable products in the form of protein-rich meals and fat \\nare produced. Extensive further processing of these by-products \\nmay not be required in some areas, if biosecurity precautions are \\ntaken. For example, high-quality inedible viscera wastes are in \\ngreat demand for intensive fish culture in some regions, and may \\nrequire only simple on-farm grinding and mixing with a binder \\nprior to use.\\nRegardless of location, before reprocessing, slaughterhouse \\nsolids can be broadly characterized as low-risk material originat-\\ning from healthy birds, and high-risk material that may transmit \\ndisease to humans, livestock or poultry. For example, high-risk \\nmaterial would originate from birds that died from causes other \\nthan slaughtering, or birds or bird parts condemned as unfit for \\nhuman consumption. Birds confirmed or suspected of carrying \\ntransmittable disease, especially a disease such as highly patho-\\ngenic avian influenza (HPIA), should be characterized as high-risk \\nmaterial. Care and management steps should be taken to keep \\nhigh-risk materials separate from low-risk materials, as mixing of \\nthe two results in the entire batch being classified as high-risk. \\nThis is important not only for health and safety precautions but \\nalso for economic reasons related to the additional processing re-\\nquirements for high-risk versus low-risk materials. The treatment \\nof high-risk material intended for animal feed or fertilizer is typi-\\ncally an energy-intensive rendering or alternative heat treatment \\nprocess, whereas reprocessing of low-risk material may include \\nless stringent methods to make use of the solids for animal or aq-\\nuaculture feed. For materials that are not suitable for processing \\ninto the food chain, alternative methods to be considered include \\napproved burial, aerobic composting or treatments for energy \\nproduction and/or processing for use as agricultural fertilizers. \\nSlaughterhouse wastes\\nCharles Michael Williams, North Carolina State University, Department of Poultry Science, Raleigh NC, United States of \\nAmerica'),\n",

Several factors have \\ncontributed to the consistent growth in world poultry produc-\\ntion, including: i) genetic progress in poultry strains for meat and \\negg production; ii) better understanding of the fundamentals of \\nnutrition; and iii) disease control. For example, the age for a meat \\nchicken to reach the market weight of 2 kg has steadily decreased \\nfrom 63 days in 1976 to 35 days in 2009, and the efficiency of \\nconverting feed into poultry products also continues to improve. \\nThis growth in poultry production is having a profound effect on \\nthe demand for feed and raw materials. Feed is the most impor-\\ntant input for poultry production in terms of cost, and the avail-\\nability of low-priced, high-quality feeds is critical if poultry pro-\\nduction is to remain competitive and continue to grow to meet \\nthe demand for animal protein.\\nProduction systems and feeding\\nHistorically, the poultry sector has evolved through three phases: \\ni) traditional systems, which include family poultry consisting of \\nscavenging birds and backyard raising; ii) small-scale semi-com-\\nmercial systems; and iii) large-scale commercial systems. Each of \\nthese systems is based on a unique set of technologies. They dif-\\nfer markedly in investment, type of birds used, husbandry level \\nand inputs such as feeds. The feed resources, feeding and feed \\nrequirements required to raise poultry also vary widely, depending \\non the system used.\\nThe traditional system is the most common type of poultry pro-\\nduction in most developing countries. Possible feed resources for \\nthe local birds raised in this system include: i) household wastes; \\nii) materials from the environment (insects, worms, snails, greens, \\nseeds, etc.); iii) crop residues, fodders and water plants; and iv) \\nby-products from local small industrial units (cereal by-products, \\netc.). The survival and growth of extensive poultry systems are \\ndetermined by the competition for feed resources in villages. This \\nsystem works well where biomass is abundant, but in areas with \\nscarce natural resources and low rainfall, the competition for nat-\\nural resources with other animals can be extreme.\\nBetween the two extremes of traditional and commercial pro-\\nduction systems is the semi-commercial system, which is charac-\\nterized by small to medium-sized flocks (50 to 500 birds) of local, \\ncrossbred or “improved” genotype stock, and the purchase of at \\nleast part of their feed from commercial compounders. Several \\nfeeding strategies may be used in this system: i) on-farm mixing \\nof complete rations, using purchased and locally available feed \\ningredients; ii) dilution of purchased commercial feeds with local \\ningredients; and iii) blending of a purchased concentrate mixture \\nwith local ingredients or whole grains.\\nThe large-scale commercial system is the dominant production \\nsystem in developed countries, and this sector has also recently \\nexpanded in many developing countries. Commercial systems are \\ncharacterized by large vertically integrated production units and \\nuse high-producing modern strains of birds. In these systems, \\nfeed is the most important variable cost component, accounting \\nfor 65 to 70 percent of production costs. High productivity and \\nefficiency depend on feeding nutritionally balanced feeds that are \\nformulated to meet the birds’ nutritional requirements.\\nPoultry need to be fed well-balanced diets\\nMost poultry species are omnivores, which in nutritional terms \\nmeans that they have a simple digestive system with non-func-\\ntional caeca. Exceptions to this general rule include geese and \\nostriches, which have well-developed functional caeca. The di-\\ngestive tract of poultry has more organs but is shorter than that \\nof other domestic animals. The unique features of this digestive \\ntract include the crop, which is a storage organ, and the gizzard, \\nwhich is a grinding organ. In fast-growing meat chickens, it takes \\nless than three hours for feed to pass from mouth to cloaca and \\nfor nutrients to be digested and absorbed. To compensate for \\nthe relatively short digestive tract and rapid digesta transit time, \\nhigh-performing birds need easily digested, nutrient-dense diets. \\nNutrient balance is critical. \\nThe rates of genetic change in growth and feed efficiency \\nover the years have also changed the physiology of the birds. \\nNutrient requirements and nutritional management have there-\\nfore changed to satisfy the genetic potential of the new strains. \\nThe high genetic potential of current poultry strains can only be \\nachieved with properly formulated feeds that are protein- and en-\\nergy-dense. Poultry, especially growing birds, are unique among \\ndomestic animals in that any change in nutrition is reflected in \\nbird performance almost immediately. This phenomenon has \\nbeen successfully exploited by the commercial poultry industry to \\nimprove growth, carcass yield and egg production.\\nThe term “poultry” encompasses a range of domesticated spe-\\ncies, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, game birds (such \\nas quails and pheasants) and ratites (emus and ostriches). This \\noverview does not discuss the nutrition of all these species, but \\nfocuses on chickens, which constitute more than 90 percent of \\nthe poultry market. However, the principles of nutritional man-\\nagement for chickens are generally applicable to other poultry \\nspecies grown for meat and eggs.'),\n",

Birds need a steady supply of energy, protein, essential \\namino acids, essential fatty acids, minerals, vitamins and, most \\nimportant, water. Poultry obtain energy and required nutrients \\nthrough the digestion of natural feedstuffs, but minerals, vitamins \\nand some key essential amino acids (lysine, methionine, threonine \\nand tryptophan) are often offered as synthetic supplements. \\nEnergy\\nPoultry can derive energy from simple carbohydrates, fat and pro-\\ntein. They cannot digest and utilize some complex carbohydrates, \\nsuch as fibre, so feed formulation should use a system based on \\navailable energy. Metabolizable energy (ME) is the conventional \\nmeasure of the available energy content of feed ingredients and \\nthe requirements of poultry. This takes account of energy losses \\nin the faeces and urine.\\nNutrient requirements \\nFor maximum growth and good health, intensively reared poul-\\ntry need a balanced array of nutrients in their diet. The nutrients \\nrequired by birds vary according to species, age and the purpose \\nof production – whether the birds are kept for meat or egg pro-\\nduction. Table 1 provides a summary of recommended minimum \\nlevels of selected nutrients for meat chickens of different ages \\nand for layers. To meet these specific needs, different classes of \\npoultry have to be fed different types of diets. These recommen-\\ndations should only be considered as guidelines and used as the \\nbasis for setting dietary nutrient concentrations in practical di-\\nets. Historically, recommendations on nutrient requirements have \\nbeen based on available literature and data from expert groups. \\nCurrently, however, because each specific genotype has its own \\nrequirements, most commercial feed formulations use minimum \\nrequirements recommended by the breeding companies that sup-\\nply the chicks.\\nMeat chickens\\nLaying hens\\nNutrient\\nUnit\\n0–3 weeks\\n3–6 weeks\\n6–8 weeks\\nMetabolizable energy\\nkcal/kg\\n3 200\\n3 200\\n3 200\\n2 900\\nMJ/kg\\n13.38\\n13.38\\n13.38\\n12.13\\nCrude protein\\n%\\n23\\n20\\n18\\n15\\nAmino acids\\nArginine\\n%\\n1.25\\n1.10\\n1.00\\n0.70\\nGlycine + Serine\\n%\\n1.25\\n1.14\\n0.97\\n-\\nHistidine\\n%\\n0.35\\n0.32\\n0.27\\n0.17\\nIsoleucine\\n%\\n0.80\\n0.73\\n0.62\\n0.65\\nLeucine\\n%\\n1.20\\n1.09\\n0.93\\n0.82\\nLysine\\n%\\n1.10\\n1.00\\n0.85\\n0.69\\nMethionine\\n%\\n0.50\\n0.38\\n0.32\\n0.30\\nMethionine + Cysteine\\n%\\n0.90\\n0.72\\n0.60\\n0.58\\nPhenylalanine\\n%\\n0.72\\n0.65\\n0.56\\n0.47\\nPhenylalanine + Tyrosine\\n%\\n1.34\\n1.22\\n1.04\\n0.83\\nThreonine\\n%\\n0.80\\n0.74\\n0.68\\n0.47\\nTryptophan\\n%\\n0.20\\n0.18\\n0.16\\n0.16\\nValine\\n%\\n0.90\\n0.82\\n0.70\\n0.70\\nFatty acid\\nLinoleic acid\\n%\\n1.00\\n1.00\\n1.00\\n1.00\\nMajor minerals\\nCalcium\\n%\\n1.00\\n0.90\\n0.80\\n3.25\\nChlorine\\n%\\n0.20\\n0.15\\n0.12\\n0.13\\nNon-phytate phosphorus\\n%\\n0.45\\n0.35\\n0.30\\n0.25\\nPotassium\\n%\\n0.30\\n0.30\\n0.30\\n0.15\\nSodium\\n%\\n0.20\\n0.15\\n0.12\\n0.15\\nTrace minerals\\nCopper\\nmg\\n8\\n8\\n8\\n-\\nIodine\\nmg\\n0.35\\n0.35\\n0.35\\n0.04\\nIron\\nmg\\n80\\n80\\n80\\n45\\nManganese\\nmg\\n60\\n60\\n60\\n20\\nSelenium\\nmg \\n0.15\\n0.15\\n0.15\\n0.06\\nZinc\\nmg\\n40\\n40\\n40\\n35\\nTABLE 1\\nRecommended minimum nutrient requirements of meat chickens and laying hens, as percentages or units per kilogram of diet (90 \\npercent dry matter)\\nSource: Adapted from National Research Council, 1994.'),\n",

The energy \\nlevel in the diet is therefore a major determinant of poultry’s feed \\nintake. When the dietary energy level changes, the feed intake \\nwill change, and the specifications for other nutrients must be \\nmodified to maintain the required intake. For this reason, the di-\\netary energy level is often used as the starting point in the formu-\\nlation of practical diets for poultry. \\nDifferent classes of poultry need different amounts of energy \\nfor metabolic purposes, and a deficiency will affect productive \\nperformance. To sustain high productivity, modern poultry strains \\nare typically fed relatively high-energy diets. The dietary energy \\nlevels used in a given situation are largely dictated by the availabil-\\nity and cost of energy-rich feedstuffs. Because of the high cost of \\ncereals, particularly maize, the use of low-energy diets for poultry \\nfeeding is not uncommon in many developing countries.\\nProtein and amino acids\\nThe function of dietary protein is to supply amino acids for main-\\ntenance, muscle growth and synthesis of egg protein. The syn-\\nthesis of muscle and egg proteins requires a supply of 20 amino \\nacids, all of which are physiological requirements. Ten of these \\nare either not synthesized at all or are synthesized too slowly to \\nmeet the metabolic requirements, and are designated as essential \\nelements of the diet. These need to be supplied in the diet. The \\nbalance can be synthesised from other amino acids; these are \\nreferred to as dietary non-essential elements and need not be \\nconsidered in feed formulations. From a physiological point of \\nview, however, all 20 amino acids are essential for the synthesis of \\nvarious proteins in the body. The essential amino acids for poultry \\nare lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, isoleucine, leucine, \\nhistidine, valine, phenylalanine and arginine. In addition, some \\nconsider glycine to be essential for young birds. Cysteine and ty-\\nrosine are considered semi-essential amino acids, because they \\ncan be synthesized from methionine and phenylalanine, respec-\\ntively. Of the ten essential amino acids, lysine, methionine and \\nthreonine are the most limiting in most practical poultry diets.\\nPoultry do not have a requirement for protein per se. However, \\nan adequate dietary supply of nitrogen from protein is essential to \\nsynthesize non-essential amino acids. This ensures that the essen-\\ntial amino acids are not used to supply the nitrogen for the syn-\\nthesis of non-essential amino acids. Satisfying the recommended \\nrequirements for both protein and essential amino acids therefore \\nensures the provision of all amino acids to meet the birds’ physi-\\nological needs. The amino acid requirements of poultry are influ-\\nenced by several factors, including production level, genotype, \\nsex, physiological status, environment and health status. For ex-\\nample, high levels of lean meat deposition require relatively high \\nlevels of lysine. High levels of egg output or feather growth re-\\nquire relatively high levels of methionine. However, most changes \\nin amino acid requirements do not lead to changes in the relative \\nproportions of the different amino acids. There is therefore an \\nideal balance of dietary amino acids for poultry, and changes in \\namino acid requirements are normally expressed in relation to a \\nbalanced protein or ideal protein.\\nFats and fatty acids\\nBecause of the greater energy density of fat compared with \\ncarbohydrates and protein, poultry diets usually include fats to \\nachieve the needed dietary energy concentration. Fat accounts \\nfor about 3 to no more than 5 percent of most practical diets. \\nOther benefits of using fats include better dust control in feed \\nmills and poultry houses, and improved palatability of diets. Poul-\\ntry do not have a specific requirement for fats as a source of en-\\nergy, but a requirement for linoleic acid has been demonstrated. \\nLinoleic acid is the only essential fatty acid needed by poultry, and \\nits deficiency has rarely been observed in birds fed practical diets. \\nLinoleic acid’s main effect in laying birds is on egg size.\\nMinerals\\nMinerals are needed for formation of the skeletal system, for gen-\\neral health, as components of general metabolic activity, and for \\nmaintenance of the body’s acid-base balance. Calcium and phos-\\nphorus are the most abundant mineral elements in the body, and \\nare classified as macro-minerals, along with sodium, potassium, \\nchloride, sulphur and magnesium. Macro-minerals are elements \\nrequired in the diet at concentrations of more than 100 mg/kg. \\nCalcium and phosphorus are necessary for the formation and \\nmaintenance of the skeletal structure and for good egg-shell \\nquality. In general, 60 to 80 percent of total phosphorus present \\nin plant-derived ingredients is in the form of phytate-phosphorus. \\nUnder normal dietary conditions, phytate phosphorus is poorly \\nutilized by poultry owing to the lack of endogenous phytase in \\ntheir digestive enzymes. It is generally assumed that about one-\\nthird of the phosphorus in plant feedstuffs is non-phytate and is \\nbiologically available to poultry, so the phosphorus requirement \\nfor poultry is expressed as non-phytate phosphorus, rather than \\ntotal phosphorus. A ratio of 2:1 must be maintained between \\ncalcium and non-phytate phosphorus in growing birds’ diets, to \\noptimize the absorption of these two minerals. The ratio in lay-\\ning birds’ diets is 13:1, because of the very high requirement for \\ncalcium for good shell quality. \\nDietary proportions of sodium (Na), potassium (K) and chlo-\\nride (Cl) largely determine the acid-base balance in the body for \\nmaintaining the physiological pH. If a shift occurs towards acid \\nor base conditions, the metabolic processes are altered to main-\\ntain the pH, with the likely result of depressed performance. The \\ndietary electrolyte balance is described by the simple formula \\n(Na+\\xa0+\\xa0K+\\xa0-\\xa0Cl-) and expressed as mEq/kg diet. Prevention of elec-\\ntrolyte imbalance needs careful consideration, especially in hot \\nclimates. Under most conditions, a balance of about 250 mEq/\\nkg of diet appears satisfactory for optimum growth. The overall \\nbalance among these three minerals, and their individual concen-\\ntrations are important. To be effective, their dietary levels must \\neach be within acceptable ranges, not deficient and not exces-\\nsive. Birds exposed to heat stress consume more water, and are \\nbetter able to withstand heat when the water contains electro-\\nlytes. The replacement of part of the supplemental dietary sodium \\nchloride with sodium bicarbonate has proved useful under these \\nconditions. \\nTrace elements, including copper, iodine, iron, manganese, se-\\nlenium, zinc and cobalt, function as components of larger mole-\\ncules and as co-factors of enzymes in various metabolic reactions. \\nThese are required in the diet in only very small amounts (Table 1). \\nPractical poultry diets should be supplemented with these major \\nand trace minerals, because typical cereal-based diets are defi-'),\n",

Water must therefore be made available at all times. \\nBoth feed intake and growth rate are highly correlated with water \\nintake. Precise requirements for water are difficult to state, and are \\ninfluenced by several factors, including ambient conditions, and \\nthe age and physiological status of the birds. Under most condi-\\ntions, water intake is assumed to be twice the amount of feed \\nintake. Drinking-water temperatures should be between 10 and \\n25 °C. Temperatures over 30 °C will reduce consumption.\\nThe quality of water is equally important. Quality is often taken \\nfor granted, but poor water quality can lead to poor productiv-\\nity and extensive economic losses. Water is an ideal medium for \\nthe distribution of contaminants, such as chemicals and minerals, \\nand the proliferation of harmful microorganisms. Water quality \\nfor poultry can be a major issue in arid and semi-arid regions \\nwhere water is scarce. In particular, underground water in these \\nareas can have high levels of salt. Saline drinking-water contain-\\ning less than 0.25 percent salt is tolerated by birds, but can cause \\nsodium toxicity if water intake is restricted. \\nReferences \\nDaghir, N.J. 1995.

Nutritional research in poultry has therefore \\ncentred on issues related to identifying barriers to effective di-\\ngestion and utilization of nutrients, and on approaches for im-\\nproving feed utilization. Poultry nutritionists have increasingly \\ncombined their expertise with that of specialists in other biologi-\\ncal sciences, including immunology, microbiology, histology and \\nmolecular biology.\\nAlthough broilers and layers are highly efficient in converting \\nfeed to food products, they still excrete significant amounts of \\nunutilized nutrients. For example, in their manure, broilers lose \\nalmost 30 percent of ingested dry matter, 25 percent of gross \\nenergy, 50 percent of nitrogen, and 55 percent of phosphorus \\nintake. There is therefore considerable room for improving the \\nefficiency of feed conversion to animal products. Much of the \\ninefficiency results from the presence of undesirable components \\nand the indigestibility of nutrients in the feed. \\nRecent advances in poultry nutrition have focussed on three main \\naspects: i) developing an understanding of nutrient metabolism \\nand nutrient requirements; ii) determining the supply and availabil-\\nity of nutrients in feed ingredients; and iii) formulating least-cost \\ndiets that bring nutrient requirements and nutrient supply together \\neffectively. The overall aim is precision feeding to lower costs and \\nmaximize economic efficiency. In the past, there was a tendency to \\noverformulate diets when there was doubt about the availability of \\ncritical nutrients (especially amino acids and phosphorus) or when \\nnutrient requirements were uncertain. This practice is no longer \\nacceptable, not only because it is wasteful, but also because excess \\nnutrients excreted in the manure are ultimately a source of pol-\\nlution. Fine-tuning diets so that they more closely match the re-\\nquirements of the birds, helps to optimize the efficiency of nutrient \\nutilization. The major developments towards achieving the goal of \\nprecision feeding are discussed in the following sections.\\nDefining nutrient requirements\\nDefining nutrient needs is challenging because they are influenced \\nby several factors and are subject to constant change. The factors \\ninfluencing nutrient requirements are of two main types: bird-\\nrelated ones, such as genetics, sex, and type and stage of produc-\\ntion; and external ones, such as thermal environment, stress and \\nhusbandry conditions. Precision in defining requirements requires \\naccuracy in both areas. Great advances in the definition of nutri-\\nent requirements for various classes of poultry have been made \\npossible largely by the increasing uniformity of genotypes, hous-\\ning and husbandry practices throughout the poultry industry.\\nDefining requirements for the ten essential amino acids has \\nbeen made easier by acceptance of the ideal protein concept. \\nAs for other nutrients, the requirements for amino acids are in-\\nfluenced by various factors, including genetics, sex, physiological \\nstatus, environment and health status. However, most changes in \\namino acid requirements do not lead to changes in the relative \\nproportion of the different amino acids. Thus actual changes in \\namino acid requirements can be expressed in relation to a bal-\\nanced protein or ideal protein. The ideal protein concept uses ly-\\nsine as the reference amino acid, and the requirements for other \\nessential amino acids are set as percentages (or ratios) of the ly-\\nsine requirement. Table 1 shows the ideal protein balances for \\nmeat chickens at different growth phases. The advantage of this \\nsystem is that once the lysine requirements for a variety of condi-\\ntions are determined, the needs for all other essential amino acids \\ncan be calculated. This approach has now become accepted prac-\\ntice for setting the amino acid specifications of feed formulations \\nin the poultry industry.\\nDefining nutrient composition and \\ningredient quality \\nPoultry producers are continually looking for opportunities that \\nallow more flexibility in both the types and the levels of feed in-\\ngredients for use in feed formulations. Such opportunities are \\nbecoming increasingly frequent because of advances in nutrient \\nanalysis and feed evaluation techniques.\\nAmino acid\\n1–21 days\\n22–42 days\\n43–56 days\\nLysine1\\n100\\n100\\n100\\nArginine\\n105\\n108\\n108\\nHistidine\\n35\\n35\\n35\\nIsoleucine\\n67\\n69\\n69\\nLeucine\\n109\\n109\\n109\\nMethionine + cysteine\\n72\\n72\\n72\\nPhenylalanine + tyrosine\\n105\\n105\\n105\\nThreonine\\n67\\n68.5\\n68.5\\nTryptophan\\n16\\n17\\n17\\nValine\\n77\\n80\\n80\\nTable 1\\nIdeal amino acid ratios of meat chickens for three growth periods\\n1\\t Recommended digestible lysine requirements for meat chickens of 1 to 21, 22 to \\n42 and 43 to 56 days are 1.070, 0.865 and 0.745 percent, respectively.'),\n",

Cur-\\nrently, considerable data are available on the ability of raw mate-\\nrials to supply these nutrients. However, a degree of variability is \\ninherent to each raw material, and this places pressure on precise \\nfeed formulations. Data on variation (or matrices) are available \\nfor the main feed ingredients and are applied in feed formulation \\nprogrammes to achieve better precision. A related development \\nis the availability of rapid tests, such as near-infrared reflectance \\nanalysis, to predict gross nutrient composition and assess the vari-\\nability in ingredient supplies on an ongoing basis. \\nIt is recognized that not all the nutrients in ingredients are avail-\\nable for production purposes, and a portion of nutrients is ex-\\ncreted undigested or not utilized. As feed evaluation techniques \\ndevelop, data have been accumulating on the availability of nu-\\ntrients for poultry, especially of amino acids and phosphorus. For \\nexample, a recent development has been the wider use of di-\\ngestible amino acid concentrations, rather than total amino acid \\nconcentrations, in feed formulations. The use of digestible ami-\\nno acid content is particularly relevant in developing countries, \\nwhere highly digestible conventional ingredients are not available \\nand diet formulations may include ingredients of low digestibility. \\nFormulating diets based on digestible amino acids makes it pos-\\nsible to increase the range of ingredients that can be used and \\nthe inclusion levels of alternative ingredients in poultry diets. This \\nimproves the precision of formulation, may lower feed costs, and \\nensures more predictable bird performance. \\nBetter feed formulation\\nOnce the nutritional needs are defined, the next step is to match \\nthese needs with combinations of ingredients and supplements. \\nThe object of formulation is to derive a balanced diet that pro-\\nvides appropriate quantities of biologically available nutrients. For \\ncommercial producers, a further object is to formulate a balanced \\ndiet at least cost. Given the range of possible feedstuffs and nu-\\ntrients needed, a large number of arithmetical calculations are \\nrequired to produce a least-cost diet. Over the years, feed formu-\\nlation has evolved from a simple balancing of a few feedstuffs \\nfor a limited number of nutrients to a linear programming system \\nthat operates with the aid of computers. Systems using stochastic \\nnon-linear programming are now becoming popular, with com-\\nmercially available formulation software. Variability in ingredient \\ncomposition is non-linear, so stochastic programmes address this \\nissue in the most cost-effective manner possible.\\nA related development is the use of growth models to simulate \\nfeed intake and production parameters under given husbandry \\nconditions. Such models are effective tools for: i) comparing ac-\\ntual versus potential performance, which can indicate the extent \\nof management or health problems in a flock; and ii) providing \\neconomic analysis of alternative feeding regimens. Several com-\\nmercial growth models are available for predicting the production \\nperformance of both meat chickens and laying hens. However, \\nbecause of the extreme complexity of biological responses, the \\nmodels are only as good as the data used to establish them. There \\nis a need for accurate and detailed information and data from a \\nvariety of production systems to enable the development of ro-\\nbust models that can provide accurate prediction of performance.\\nApplication\\nAim(s) of the technology\\n1.

Most of the feed used in the production of meat \\nchickens is fed in pelleted or crumbled form, which enhances \\nthe economics of production by improving feed efficiency and \\ngrowth performance. These improvements are attributed to de-\\ncreased feed wastage, higher nutrient density, reduced selective \\nfeeding, decreased time and energy spent on eating, destruction \\nof pathogenic organisms, and thermal modification of starch and \\nprotein.

In practice, however, grow-out periods \\ncan range from four to ten weeks of age, depending on local \\nmarket needs. Recognizing that changes in nutrient needs are \\nmore dynamic than these general recommendations, the com-\\nmercial poultry industry is increasingly using phase-feeding sys-\\ntems to maximize performance and increase profit margins. Di-\\netary protein and amino acid specifications are usually decreased \\nin a progression of different feeds that satisfy changing require-\\nments and economics. Typical feeding programmes over a five- to \\nseven-week production cycle now include four to five feeds, such \\nas pre-starter, starter, grower and finisher; or pre-starter, starter, \\ngrower, finisher and withdrawal. The withdrawal diets often fed \\nduring the last seven to ten days of growth involve removal of \\ncertain pharmaceutical additives and reduction of protein/amino \\nacids. In recent years, they have also involved the reduction of \\ncertain vitamins and trace minerals, and energy.\\nWhole grain feeding\\nAnother recent development has been the feeding of whole \\ngrains (wheat or barley) along with a balanced concentrate feed. \\nThe benefits of whole grain feeding include better performance, \\nreduced feed processing costs and improved flock health. These \\nbenefits appear to arise from a combination of two physiological \\nactions: physical benefits of gizzard development and increased \\nproventriculus secretions; and better matching of daily require-\\nments through self-selection by the bird. The usual method of \\nwhole grain feeding is to blend 10 to 25 percent of the weight \\nof the feed on top of the feed in delivery trucks or at the poultry \\nhouse. \\nSustainable poultry feeding\\nNot long ago, the main objective of formulating feeds was to \\nsupply nutrients (nutrient input). Today there is much public con-\\ncern about what comes out of the bird (nutrient output). Animal \\nagriculture, including the commercial poultry sector, is clearly re-\\nleasing excess nutrients into the environment, and must assume \\nresponsibility for its impact on the environment, especially on wa-\\nter quality. Without question, the poultry industry must achieve \\nthe goal of sustainability, as environmental concerns have a major \\ninfluence on its future growth and expansion. From a nutrition \\npoint of view, the most obvious strategy is to feed birds to match \\ntheir requirements (precision feeding) and to improve the effi-\\nciency of birds’ nutrient utilization, which will reduce the nutrient \\nload in manure. \\nReferences \\nLeeson, S. & Summers, J.D. 2005.

Of total feed cost, about 95 \\npercent is used to meet energy and protein requirements, about 3 \\nto 4 percent for major mineral, trace mineral and vitamin require-\\nments, and 1 to 2 percent for various feed additives. Poultry diets \\nare formulated from a mixture of ingredients, including cereal \\ngrains, cereal by-products, fats, plant protein sources, animal by-\\nproducts, vitamin and mineral supplements, crystalline amino ac-\\nids and feed additives. These are assembled on a least-cost basis, \\ntaking into consideration their nutrient contents as well as their \\nunit prices. Table 1 shows common ingredients used in poultry \\nfeed formulations in most parts of the world. \\nMain ingredients: availability issues\\nEnergy sources constitute the largest component of poultry di-\\nets, followed by plant protein sources and animal protein sources. \\nGlobally, maize (corn) is the most commonly used energy source, \\nand soybean meal is a common plant protein source. However, \\nother grains such as wheat and sorghum, and plant protein meals \\nsuch as canola meal, peas and sunflower meal are also widely \\nused in some countries. The main animal protein ingredients are \\nfishmeal and meat meal. Almost all developing countries are net \\nimporters of these ingredients; the poultry feed industries in Afri-\\nca and Asia depend on imports, which are a drain on their foreign \\nexchange reserves. Quite often, the semi-commercial and com-\\nmercial sectors in these countries are forced to limit their output \\nof compounded feeds. \\nThe diversion of grains, particularly maize, from the animal \\nfeed market to ethanol production is a major recent development \\nthat has caused severe grain supply problems in the world mar-\\nket, with dramatic price increases. With government policies to \\npromote the use of biofuels, the global production of ethanol \\nhas rapidly increased in recent years, and further large increases \\nare expected in the future. Despite record prices, the import de-\\nmand for main ingredients in developing countries continues to \\nincrease to meet the feed demands of an expanding poultry sec-\\ntor, putting further pressure on prices. Paradoxically, the solution \\nfor the rocketing price of maize could come from the biofuel in-\\ndustry, through its major co-product – distillers’ dried grains with \\nsolubles (DDGS) – which has been shown to be a good source \\nof available amino acids and energy. Worldwide, feed millers are \\nshowing keen interest in DDGS because of its cost-effectiveness \\nand ready availability. Good-quality DDGS is a potentially useful \\nfeed ingredient, containing about 25 percent protein and 10 per-\\ncent fat, and rich mineral and vitamin resources. The amino acid \\navailability in DDGS is similar to that in soybean meal. This may be \\nthe only raw material whose supply is assured and will increase \\nin the future.\\nMain energy source\\nThe predominant feedgrain used in poultry feeds worldwide is \\nmaize. This is mainly because its energy source is starch, which \\nis highly digestible for poultry. In addition, it is highly palatable, \\nis a high-density source of readily available energy, and is free of \\nanti-nutritional factors. The metabolizable energy value of maize \\nis generally considered the standard with which other energy \\nsources are compared. \\nIn North America and Brazil, the feed industry has benefited \\nfrom surplus maize, resulting from increased mechanization and \\nthe application of genetic and agronomic techniques to raise pro-\\nductivity. In the Asian and African regions, however, maize yield \\nper hectare is low, and in most countries, production has never \\nbeen sufficient to meet the needs of the growing human popula-\\ntion. The net result is a continuing shortage of maize for feed use \\nin these regions.\\nThe other energy source that meets most of the same criteria as \\nmaize is low-tannin sorghum. Sorghum can be grown in low-rain-\\nfall areas and is a popular crop in hot, drought-prone regions. The \\nhigh tannin content of many older sorghum varieties limits their \\nuse in poultry diets, but low-tannin varieties are now available and \\ncan be used in poultry diets without any limitation. The energy \\nvalue of low-tannin sorghum is 90 to 95 percent that of maize.\\n1.\\tEnergy sources: \\n-\\t cereals (mainly maize),1 cereal by-products\\n-\\t animal fats and vegetable oils\\n2.\\tPlant protein sources:2 soybean meal\\n3.\\tAnimal protein sources: fishmeal, meat and bone meal\\n4.\\tMineral supplements:\\n-\\t calcium supplements: limestone, shell grit\\n-\\t calcium and phosphorus supplements: dicalcium phosphate, defluorinated\\n\\t rock phosphate, bone meal\\n-\\t trace minerals: trace mineral premixes\\n-\\t sodium sources: salt, sodium bicarbonate\\n5.\\tMiscellaneous:\\n-\\t vitamin supplements: vitamin premixes\\n-\\t crystalline amino acids: methionine, lysine, threonine\\n-\\t non-nutritive feed additives: enzymes, antibiotics, etc.\\nTable 1\\nCommon ingredients used in typical poultry feed formulations\\n1\\t Wheat and sorghum are widely used in some parts of the world.\\n2\\t Canola meal, peas and sunflower meal are also used in some parts of the world.'),\n",

Plant protein sources \\nsupply the major portion of dietary protein (or nitrogen) require-\\nments. The plant protein source traditionally used for feed manu-\\nfacture is soybean meal, which is the preferred source for poultry \\nfeed. \\nSoybean meal contains 40 to 48 percent crude protein, de-\\npending on the amount of hulls removed and the oil extraction \\nprocedure. Relative to other oilseed meals, soybean protein has \\na good balance of essential amino acids, which can complement \\nmost cereal-based diets. The amino acid availability in soybean \\nmeal is higher than those for other oilseed meals. The metabo-\\nlizable energy content is also substantially higher than in other \\noilseed meals.\\nRaw soybeans contain several anti-nutritional factors, including \\nprotease inhibitors, which can negatively affect protein digestion \\nand bird performance. However, these inhibitors are destroyed by \\nheat during the processing of soybean meal. Properly processed \\nsoybean meal is an excellent protein source for all classes of poul-\\ntry, with no restrictions on its use.\\nSoybean production has increased substantially over the past \\ntwo decades to meet the rising demands for oil for the human \\nfood market and meal for the animal feed market. The major pro-\\nducers of soybeans are the United States, Brazil and Argentina, \\nwhich are also the major exporters. More than 50 percent of the \\ncurrent crop is now genetically modified (GM), mainly for herbi-\\ncide tolerance, and there is an ongoing debate and campaign to \\nreject GM ingredients from animal diets. If GM sources are not \\naccepted in the market place, the potential for further nutritional \\nquality enhancement and increased productivity will be limited. \\nMain animal protein sources\\nWith the notable exception of soybean meal, plant protein sourc-\\nes are generally nutritionally imbalanced in terms of essential ami-\\nno acids, particularly lysine, the first limiting amino acid in cereals. \\nUnless supplemented with animal protein sources and crystalline \\namino acids, plant-based diets may not meet the requirements \\nfor critical amino acids for egg and meat production. Owing to \\ntheir high prices, animal protein ingredients are normally used \\nto balance the amino acid contents of diets rather than as major \\nsources of protein. In many countries, feed manufacturers ensure \\nthat animal protein ingredients do not fall below minimum levels \\nin poultry diets, especially for young birds whose amino acid re-\\nquirements are high. The requirements for essential amino acids \\nare progressively reduced as the birds grow older, and it is pos-\\nsible to meet the needs of older birds with diets containing lower \\nlevels of animal protein and relatively higher levels of plant pro-\\ntein. Fishmeal and meat meal are the animal protein sources most \\nwidely used in poultry diets\\nFishmeal\\nFishmeal is an exceptionally good source of high-quality pro-\\ntein, and its price usually reflects this. It also provides abundant \\namounts of minerals (calcium, phosphorus and trace minerals), \\nB vitamins and essential fatty acids. The presence of unidentified \\ngrowth factors is another feature of fishmeal. Feed formulations \\ntherefore seek to ensure minimum levels of fishmeal in diets.\\nFishmeal consists essentially of dried, ground carcasses of fish. \\nGood-quality fishmeal is brown, but the colour varies according \\nto the type of fish used and the processing conditions. A very \\ndark colour is indicative of overheating, which can destroy amino \\nacids, reduce amino acid availability and substantially lower the \\nprotein quality.\\nFishmeal is an important – sometimes the only – source of ani-\\nmal protein ingredients in most developing countries. It is either \\nimported or locally produced. Local fishmeals typically contain \\nbetween 40 and 50 percent crude protein, compared with more \\nthan 60 percent protein in imported fishmeals. Local fishmeals \\nare generally of low quality owing to lack of control over raw fish \\nquality, processing and storage conditions. They are often adul-\\nterated with cheap diluents, including poor-quality protein sourc-\\nes (dried poultry manure, oilseed meals), urea and non-nutritive \\ndiluents such as sand. Some fishmeals may be objectionable be-\\ncause of putrefaction, impurities or excessive salt content. Sam-\\nples containing as much as 15 percent salt are not uncommon. \\nThis situation underlines the lack of quality control measures in \\nmost developing countries. As salt has laxative and growth de-\\npressing effects, the salt content of fishmeals should be carefully \\nmonitored; it should be less than 3 percent for best results, but \\nlegally may be up to 7 percent. \\nThe correct quantity of fishmeal to include depends on the \\ntypes of cereal and oilseed meals in the feed formulation. The \\ncost of fishmeal is another important determinant. In general, av-\\nerage inclusion levels may be up to 8 percent for young birds, and \\nless than 4 percent for older meat birds and layers. Higher levels \\nmust be avoided in finishing and laying diets, as they may lend a \\nfishy taint to meat and eggs. Use of fishmeal can compensate, to \\nan extent, where husbandry conditions are less than ideal. \\nFuture expansion possibilities in fishmeal production are lim-\\nited. Production does not seem to have increased over the past 20 \\nyears, and is unlikely to do so in the future, given the pressures on \\nworld fisheries. Fishmeal is included in the overall animal protein \\nban in Europe, and there is also an underlying concern about pos-\\nsible pollutant (e.g., dioxin) levels in fishmeal.\\nMeat meal\\nMeat meal contains relatively high levels of protein, calcium and \\navailable phosphorus. Meat meal is the dry-rendered product \\nfrom mammalian tissues, excluding hair, hooves, horns, hide \\ntrimmings, blood and stomach contents, except in such amounts \\nas occur in good slaughterhouse practice. Meat meals are de-\\nrived mainly from bones and associated tissues such as tendons, \\nligaments, some skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal tract, lungs and \\ncondemned livers. Variation in the proportions of these raw ma-\\nterials contributes to the large variations in meat meal quality. \\nDepending on the proportion of bone to soft tissue used in the \\nmanufacture, the finished product is designated as meat meal \\n(containing more than 55 percent crude protein and less than \\n4.4 percent phosphorus) or meat and bone meal (containing less \\nthan 55 percent crude protein and more than 4.4 percent phos-\\nphorus). \\nCollagen is the major protein in bone, connective tissue, car-\\ntilage and tendon, and contains no tryptophan. In poor-quality \\nmeat meals, 50 to 65 percent of total protein may be collagen. In-\\ncreasing the level of bone in meat meal lowers the nutritive value,'),\n",

In addition to energy and protein, \\nformulations contain supplements to provide minerals, vitamins \\nand specific amino acids. These supplements must be added to all \\ndiets as they provide essential nutrients necessary for health and \\nperformance. Modern feed formulations also contain a diverse \\nrange of non-nutritive additives, which may not be essential but \\nhave an important bearing on performance and health. In many \\ncases, the need for their inclusion is well understood: A major fac-\\ntor to be considered in selecting these additives is their efficacy. \\nFeed supplements and additives are used in only small quantities, \\nand it is particularly important that they are mixed carefully with \\nthe main ingredients so that they are evenly distributed.\\nNutritional supplements used in poultry feed \\nformulations\\nMineral supplements\\nOnly part of birds’ mineral requirements is provided by the natural \\nfeedstuffs in their diets. Mineral supplements must therefore be \\nincluded in feed formulations.\\nMajor minerals: Poultry require relatively large amounts of some \\nminerals, such as calcium, phosphorus and sodium. Calcium and \\nphosphorus are needed for normal growth and skeletal develop-\\nment, and poultry have unusually high requirements for calcium \\nduring the period of egg production, for the formation of strong \\negg shells. The calcium supplements commonly used in poultry \\nfeeding are limestone, crushed sea shells or sea-shell flour. Lime-\\nstone powder can be included at no more than 3 percent, be-\\ncause higher levels will lower feed intake. It is therefore necessary \\nto provide the extra calcium needed by high-producing layers as \\nshell grit or limestone grit.\\nTo meet the phosphorus needs of poultry, formulations must \\nbe supplemented with inorganic phosphorus sources. In diets \\ncontaining fishmeal and meat and bone meal, supplementa-\\ntion with inorganic sources may not be necessary. The inorganic \\nphosphates used in poultry diets are dicalcium phosphate, bone \\nmeal, rock phosphate, defluorinated phosphate and tricalcium \\nphosphate, all of which supply both calcium and phosphorus. It is \\nimportant that the inorganic phosphates are obtained from reli-\\nable sources, as contamination with fluorine can be a problem in \\nsome regions. Excess levels of fluorine in the phosphate source \\ncan adversely affect bird performance.\\nA recent development in phosphorus nutrition has been the \\navailability of commercial phytase enzymes, which assist the bird’s \\ndigestion and utilization of the phosphorus bound in phytic acid. \\nThis enzyme improves the availability of phosphorus from plant \\nmaterials and reduces the need for inorganic phosphates in feed \\nformulations. This enzyme is a non-nutritive additive.\\nCommon salt is included in all diets as a source of sodium and \\nan appetite stimulant. Salt is added in poultry diets at levels of 0.2 \\nto 0.4 percent. Excessive salt increases water consumption and \\nleads to wet excreta. The use of salt can be lowered or even omit-\\nted if more than 5 percent fishmeal is used in the diet.\\nMost formulations also contain 0.2 to 0.3 percent sodium bi-\\ncarbonate (common baking soda); inclusion of this substance is \\nparticularly important in hot climates. When environmental tem-\\nperatures are high, birds increase their respiration rate to increase \\nthe rate of evaporative cooling, thereby losing excessive amounts \\nof carbon dioxide. This may be reflected in reduced growth rate \\nand a decline in egg-shell quality, often seen in high-producing \\nlayers. Under these conditions, the replacement of part of the \\nsupplemental salt with sodium bicarbonate is recommended. \\nTrace minerals: These elements are required in the diet at con-\\ncentrations in trace amounts, usually about 0.01 percent. Trace \\nminerals (zinc, copper, iron, manganese, cobalt, selenium) are \\ntherefore usually added in the form of propriety premixes.\\nVitamin supplements\\nAll vitamins, except vitamin C, must be provided in the diet. Vi-\\ntamins are required in only small amounts, and are usually pro-\\nvided in propriety vitamin premixes, which can be purchased from \\ncommercial suppliers. Although vitamin premixes represent only \\n0.05 percent of the diet, they can have a large effect on bird \\nperformance. \\nCrystalline amino acids\\nPure forms of individual amino acids are now commercially avail-\\nable. Currently the limiting amino acids in poultry diets – me-\\nthionine, lysine, threonine and tryptophan (in that order) – can \\nbe purchased at reasonable cost and included in poultry diets to \\nbalance dietary amino acid levels. Amino acid supplements now \\nplay a very important role in improving protein utilization in ani-\\nmal feeding.'),\n",

These are non-nutritive substances usually \\nadded in amounts of less than 0.05 percent to maintain health \\nstatus, uniformity and production efficiency in intensive produc-\\ntion systems. These additives have now become vital components \\nof practical diets. Table 1 presents a list of commonly used feed \\nadditives.\\nTwo recent developments relating to feed additives deserve \\nspecial mention. First, there is increased interest in the use of feed \\nenzymes to improve the utilization of nutrients in raw materials \\nand to reduce feed cost. Improvements in nutrient availability are \\nachieved by one or more of the following mechanisms: i) degra-\\ndation of specific bonds in ingredients not usually degraded by \\nendogenous digestive enzymes; ii) degradation of anti-nutritive \\nfactors that lower the availability of nutrients; iii) increased ac-\\ncessibility of nutrients to endogenous digestive enzymes; and iv) \\nsupplementation of the enzyme capacity of young animals. En-\\nzymes widely used in the poultry industry are the carbohydrases \\nthat cleave the viscous fibre components in cereals (Table 1) and \\nphytases that target the phytic acid-complexes in plant ingredi-\\nents. More recently, technically successful enzyme preparations \\nfor use in maize-soybean diets have become available. Future ad-\\nvances in feed enzyme technology will involve the development \\nof enzymes that can be used to target the anti-nutritive factors in \\nnon-traditional feedstuffs and improve their feeding value. \\nThe second development is the recent ban on the use of in-feed \\nantibiotics in animal feeds in some countries. In other countries, \\nthe number of in-feed antibiotics available for use in poultry diets \\nhas been restricted. Antibiotics have been used in poultry diets \\nfor many years as protection against pathogens and sub-clinical \\ndiseases, and for the resulting improved growth.

Much of the increase in global demand for \\npoultry products will be in developing countries. Such growth in \\nthe poultry industry is having a profound effect on the demand \\nfor feed and raw materials. However, it is also becoming clear \\nthat the requirements for the four traditional feed ingredients – \\nmaize, soybean meal, fishmeal and meat meal – cannot be met, \\neven according to optimistic forecasts. The gap between local \\nsupply and demand for these traditional ingredients is expected \\nto widen over the coming decades, providing a compelling reason \\nfor exploring the usefulness of locally available, alternative feed-\\nstuffs in feed formulations. \\nA wide range of alternative feedstuffs are available for feeding \\nin all three poultry production systems. The greatest potential for \\nefficiently utilizing these feedstuffs will be in traditional family \\npoultry systems (scavenging and backyard) and the semi-com-\\nmercial system. In the semi-commercial system, only part of the \\nfeed requirement is purchased from commercial compounders, so \\nthere is opportunity for on-farm mixing or dilution of purchased \\nfeeds with locally available, alternative feedstuffs. In low-input \\nfamily poultry systems, locally available, alternative feedstuffs can \\nbe used to supplement the scavenging feed base.\\nNon-traditional feedstuffs – the issues\\nAlternative feedstuffs are often referred as “non-traditional feed-\\nstuffs” because they have not traditionally been used in animal \\nfeeding or are not normally used in commercial animal diets. \\nHowever, it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between tradi-\\ntional and non-traditional feeds. Feedstuffs that may be classified \\nas non-traditional in some regions, may actually be traditional \\nand based on many years of usage in others.  Some feedstuffs \\nmay have started as non-traditional, but are now being used in-\\ncreasingly in commercial diets. A good example is palm kernel \\nmeal, which is a non-traditional feedstuff in Western Africa, but \\nan increasingly normal feedstuff for feed millers in Southeast \\nAsia, especially in pullet and layer diets.\\nIt is widely recognized that in developing African and Asian \\ncountries, existing feed resources in many circumstances are ei-\\nther unutilized and wasted or used inefficiently. Most of these \\nalternative feedstuffs have obvious potential, but their use has \\nbeen negligible owing to constraints imposed by nutritional, tech-\\nnical and socio-economic factors (Table 1). Three major criteria \\ndetermine the regular use of a feedstuff in commercial diets: i) it \\nmust be available in economic quantities, even if its availability is \\nseasonal; ii) the price must be competitive against the main feed-\\nstuffs; and iii) its nutritive value must be understood, including \\nits nutrient content, existing variation and nutrient digestibility. \\nIn many developing countries, in may be difficult to assess the \\nnutritive value of any feedstuff, owing to the lack or scarcity of \\nappropriate research or analytical facilities. This is a major factor \\ndiscouraging commercial feed mills from considering the use of \\nalternative ingredients.\\nThere has been keen interest in evaluating alternative feed re-\\nsources over the years, and a proliferation of published data, es-\\npecially from developing countries. Lists of alternative feedstuffs \\nthat seem to have the greatest potential as substitutes for maize, \\nsoybean meal and animal proteins are presented in Tables 2, 3 \\nand 4, respectively. These lists are by no means exhaustive; this in-\\nformation note does not aim to review all the available literature \\non each individual ingredient, but rather to identify the general \\nissues limiting their use and maximum inclusion levels in com-\\nmercial poultry diets. \\nFuture prospects for alternative feedstuffs\\nThe immediate prospects for the use of alternative feedstuffs \\nlisted in Tables 2, 3 and 4 will be in semi-commercial poultry units \\nthat employ some degree of on-farm feed mixing, and family \\npoultry units.

The effect of supplemental enzymes on alternative \\nfeedstuffs is twofold: first, they eliminate or reduce the action of \\nanti-nutritive factors; and second, they increase digestibility and \\nimprove nutritive value\\nThe greatest potential for using alternative feedstuffs is in the \\nfeeding of layers, irrespective of the production system. Owing \\nto physiological differences, pullets and layers are more tolerant \\nto high fibre, poor-quality feedstuffs and nutritional challenges \\nthan fast-growing meat birds are. Some of these feedstuffs can \\nbe included at high levels, but have negative effects on egg pro-\\nduction. Rice bran and palm kernel meal are good examples of \\nthis tolerance; both can be used at maximum levels of only 10 \\npercent in broiler diets, but may be safely incorporated into pullet \\nand layer diets at levels of up to 30 percent.\\nSupplementary feeding strategies for family \\npoultry\\nThe scavenging area for family poultry is usually limited and often \\nover-scavenged. The quantity and quality of the feed base for \\nfamily poultry are also very variable, depending particularly on the \\nseason, but also on rainfall and agricultural activities. The supply \\nof protein, minerals and vitamins is often high during the rainy \\nseason, owing to the abundance of insects and green materials, \\nbut becomes critical during the dry season. On the other hand, \\nmost of the materials available are deficient in energy through-\\nout most of the year, because the feed base is generally high \\nin fibre. Overall, feed consumed by family poultry can be con-\\nsidered deficient in all major nutrients – energy, protein, calcium \\nand phosphorus. It is therefore recognized that scavenging alone \\nwill not provide enough feed to support the needs for growth or \\negg production, and that body weights and egg numbers can be \\nmarkedly improved by the provision of supplementary feed. Small \\namounts of strategically administered supplements are likely to \\nincrease production and minimize mortality. Several of the alter-\\nnative feedstuffs identified in this information note can play an \\nimportant role as supplementary feeds.\\nUnlike the intensive poultry production system, the family poul-\\ntry system lends itself well to the inclusion of locally available, \\nalternative feedstuffs. Most of these feedstuffs are available only \\nseasonally, in limited quantities and in specific locations, but can \\neasily be accommodated within the family poultry system. Many \\nof these materials are dusty in nature, and could be wasted if of-\\nfered in dry form. To avoid wastage, these materials are therefore \\nbest offered as wet mash.\\nEnergy supplements\\nThe main feature of the traditional poultry system is that it does \\nnot directly compete with humans for the same food. However, \\nwhere possible, it is advisable to offer small amounts of grains \\nsuch as millets, maize and sorghum as energy supplements. At-\\ntention must therefore be paid to available cereal by-products. In \\nmost households and locations, several by-products from cereal \\nmilling are available for animal feeding, including  bran, hulls and \\nscreenings. Despite their high fibre contents, these can be valu-\\nable sources of energy. \\nSmall and damaged tubers and roots of cassava, sweet pota-\\ntoes and yams, which are unfit for human consumption, are avail-\\nable in many areas and could be processed into a high-energy \\nanimal feed. The most practical method is to slice, sun-dry and \\npound or grind them into a meal. Cassava peels (which constitute \\n10 percent of the tuber weight) are not used for human con-\\nsumption, and represent an economical feed for family poultry. \\nHowever, they contain high levels of cyanide and must be pro-\\ncessed to eliminate this toxic factor prior to feeding; simple sun-\\ndrying is adequate for this. Residues from the production of fer-\\nmented cassava products can also be useful energy supplements.\\nA number of locally available fruit by-products can be used to \\nprovide energy. A good example is banana peels, which can be \\ncollected from local markets, sun-dried and milled into a meal. \\nProper drying is important to avoid spoilage and bacterial growth. \\nA similar meal can be prepared from mango seed kernel, which \\nhas to be boiled prior to drying. On their own, both these meals \\nhave poor palatability and have to be offered in a mixture with \\nother feedstuffs.\\nIn areas where breweries or fruit processing operations are lo-\\ncated, by-products may be collected and offered to poultry in wet \\nform. These materials are good sources of supplemental energy.\\nProtein supplements\\nGreen materials\\nGreen materials are the cheapest sources of protein available to \\nfamily poultry. A wide range of materials are available, including \\nherbs, fodder leaves (e.g., leucaena, calliandra, sesbania), leaves \\nfrom cultivated plants (e.g., cassava) and aquatic plants (e.g., \\nazolla, water hyacinth, duckweed). These can be grown in small \\nplots around the household. Where lagoons are available, the \\ncultivation of aquatic plants should be promoted. The advantage \\nof green materials is their high dry matter yields, which can be \\nharvested and fed directly to poultry in fresh form. Not only are \\nthese materials good sources of protein, but they are also rich in \\npigments, vitamins and minerals. \\nIndustrial by-products\\nBy-products from local industries such as oil mills (palm kernel \\nFeedstuff\\nComments\\nDried fish silage\\nA way of turning waste fish into quality \\nanimal protein supplement; can completely \\nreplace fishmeal\\nLimitation: requires drying\\nBlood meal\\nHigh protein content\\nLimitations: extremely deficient in isoleucine, \\npoor palatability; can be included at no more \\nthan 5%  \\nHydrolysed feather meal\\nHigh protein content\\nLimitations: deficient in several essential \\namino acids, low availability of amino acids; \\ncan be included at no more than 5%\\nPoultry by-product meal\\nFeeding value similar to that of meat meal; \\nrecommended inclusion level of 5%\\nSkimmed milk powder\\nReject milk powder; good-quality protein; can \\nbe included at up to 5%\\nNovel sources: \\ninsects, fly larvae, earthworms, \\ntermites, bees, snails, etc.\\nGood protein sources; can replace 50% of \\nfishmeal in formulations; useful supplements \\nfor family poultry \\nLimitation: no commercial production and \\nharvesting systems\\nTable 4\\nAlternative animal protein sources for use in poultry diets'),\n",

Some of these \\nmaterials are already used to supplement the feeding of family \\npoultry.\\nAnimal and fish by-products\\nIn areas where there are fishing and meat processing operations, \\nthere is good potential for using offal for poultry feeding, in ei-\\nther fresh form or after processing. For example, the edible flesh \\nof most types of fish represents only 40 percent of their total \\nweight, leaving 60 percent for use as a protein feed resource. \\nScrap fish and fish wastes or residues (heads and offal) can be \\ndried and processed into a meal, or be preserved as silage. The \\ntechnique for making fish silage is simple, but the producer re-\\nquires training.\\n \\nMeals from insects\\nInsects can be used to produce cheaper proteins from non-food \\nanimals. Insects are part of the natural diet of poultry, and scav-\\nenging poultry consume a wide variety, including grasshoppers, \\ncrickets, termites, aphids, scale insects, beetles, caterpillars, pupa, \\nflies, fleas, bees, wasps and ants. Insects are rich in protein, with \\nreported protein contents ranging from 40 to 75 percent. These \\nnovel protein sources can be collected from surrounding areas. \\nThere is also opportunity for the production of insects using \\nwaste materials.\\nInsect larva: The biological digestion of animal wastes by the \\nlarval stage of flies (especially house and soldier flies), and the \\nharvest and use of larvae and pupae is a cheap way of supplying \\nhigh-protein materials to family poultry. Insect larva can be pro-\\nduced from kitchen and animal wastes. The materials are left to \\ndecompose in a protected area, where insects come and lay their \\neggs. Guidelines on the medium- to large-scale production of fly \\npupae using animal wastes describe how light is used to induce \\nthe migration of larvae out of the waste, through a screen and \\ninto a lower compartment, where they pupate and are harvested.\\nTermites: Termites are not only collected from nature, but can \\nalso be grown near the family unit and harvested. Termites have \\na unique ability to digest fibre, and the production of termites \\nshould be linked to the recycling of wood and paper wastes. A \\nsimple method of rearing termites on crop residues for family \\npoultry supplementation is practised in some African countries. \\nThis involves the use of inverted clay pots containing termites and \\nfilled with moistened fibrous material. The pots must be protect-\\ned against excessive heat and desiccation, and the termite larvae \\ncan be harvested after three to four weeks. \\nMeals from small animals \\nEarthworms: Earthworms are a natural food source for poultry \\nkept under free-range systems and, live or dried, are highly palat-\\nable to poultry. Worm cultivation for fishing is common in many \\ncountries. Earthworms can also easily be produced and harvested \\nfor feeding family poultry, based on the biodegradation of animal \\nmanure. Techniques for the culture of earthworms (referred to \\nas vermiculture) are well established and can be modified to suit \\nsmall-scale production systems. Successful culture of earthworms \\nrequires: i) a food source; ii) adequate moisture (more than 50 \\npercent water content); iii) adequate aeration; and iv) protection \\nfrom excessive heat. A kilogram of earthworms consumes and \\ndigests 0.5 to 1.0 kg of waste a day. Because worms are top \\nfeeders, most of them will be found in the top 10 to 20 cm of the \\nmanure and can easily be harvested. Alternatively, the chickens \\ncan be let into the area to harvest the worms themselves. Under \\nsuitable growing conditions, up to 30 000 worms per square me-\\ntre of surface area may be harvested.\\nSnails: The African giant snail is a major garden pest, which is \\nparticularly abundant during the wet season. The collection and \\nuse of snails as animal feed is therefore also of interest in the con-\\ntext of pest control. The bodies of snails contain hydrocyanic acid, \\npresumably accumulated from the ingestion of cyanide-contain-\\ning materials, but this toxic factor can be completely eliminated \\nby cooking. \\nMineral and vitamin supplements\\nScavenging birds have far greater opportunity to balance their \\nown micronutrient requirements. In the scavenging situation, \\nminerals and vitamins are often provided from organic and non-\\norganic materials pecked from the environment by the birds. \\nImportant sources of minerals and vitamins include snail shells, \\ninsects, fruits and fresh green materials.\\nReferences\\nEl Boushy, A.R.Y. & van der Poel, A.F.B. 1994.

Public concerns over food safety have \\nheightened in recent years, because of problems such as bovine \\nspongiform encephalopathy (BSE), melamine and dioxin con-\\ntaminations, outbreaks of food-borne bacterial infections, and \\npotential microbial resistance to antibiotics. Given the direct links \\nbetween feed safety and the safety of foods of animal origin, it is \\nessential that feed production and manufacture procedures meet \\nstringent safety requirements. \\nSome sources of feed contamination are high priorities in all \\nproduction systems and countries: i) mycotoxins (or fungal tox-\\nins); ii) pathogenic biological agents; and iii) various chemicals. \\nThese agents may contaminate feed at any stage of production \\nup to the point of feeding, and can result in hazards in food of \\nanimal origin. Biological agents and chemicals normally enter the \\nfeed supply under specific conditions. Mycotoxins are more wide-\\nspread, however, particularly in developing countries, because of \\nimproper agricultural, storage and processing practices. Not only \\ndo mycotoxins represent a food safety issue, but they can also \\nhave serious consequences on poultry performance, and so are \\ndiscussed in some detail in this information note. \\nDisease-causing biological agents\\nPoultry feed may be the source of human illness resulting from \\nthe consumption of poultry products. The agent of major con-\\ncern in poultry feeds is salmonella, which is associated with food \\npoisoning in humans. The principal manifestation of human sal-\\nmonellosis is gastroenteritis. Salmonella is widely distributed in \\nnature, and animal feed is only one of many sources for farm \\nanimals. Feedstuffs of animal origin are particularly frequently \\ncontaminated with salmonella. \\nSalmonella contamination can be avoided by sourcing and us-\\ning salmonella-negative feedstuffs in diet formulation. Heat treat-\\nments of varying severity are commonly used to ensure the micro-\\nbiological quality of animal feed. \\nChemical contamination\\nA wide range of chemicals can enter the feed production system, \\nintentionally or unintentionally. Potential hazards include veteri-\\nnary drugs, agricultural chemicals (e.g., pesticides, fungicides), in-\\ndustrial chemicals (e.g., dioxin), heavy metals (e.g., mercury, lead, \\ncadmium) and adulterants (e.g., melamine). These chemicals can \\naccumulate in animal tissues, or are excreted in milk or incorpo-\\nrated in eggs, and cause health problems in humans.\\nSome veterinary drugs, such as antibiotics and coccidiostats, \\nare routinely included in poultry feeds as additives. In meat-pro-\\nducing birds, the problem of  drug residues in meat are overcome \\nby providing a withdrawal diet containing no drugs for seven to \\nten days prior to slaughter. However, the possible development \\nof microbial resistance due to the use of antimicrobials in animal \\ndiets has become a major public concern in recent years. As a \\nresult, the use of in-feed antibiotics is either banned or restricted \\nin the poultry industries of developed countries.\\nMost other chemical contaminants enter feeds through plant \\nmaterials, especially cereals and treated seeds. The levels of \\nchemicals in plant materials are closely related to the levels of soil \\ncontaminants where they are grown. Similarly, animal fats used \\nin formulations may contain high levels of lipid-soluble contami-\\nnants if they are produced from feed grown in polluted areas \\nMycotoxins\\nThe term “mycotoxin” refers to all toxins produced by various \\ntypes of fungus when they grow on agricultural products before \\nor after harvest or during transportation or storage. The most \\ncommonly affected feedstuffs are cereals, oilseeds and oilseed \\nmeals. These toxins have the capacity not only to impair bird \\nperformance, but also to affect humans through toxin residues \\nthat can be deposited in animal tissues. Many mycotoxins with \\ndifferent chemical structures and biological activities have been \\nidentified.

The majority of \\nFusarium fungi have the ability to produce toxins. Of particular \\nimportance are the trichothecenes, zearalenone (ZEN) and the \\nfumonisins. The trichothecenes include T-2 toxin and deoxyniva-\\nlenol (DON; also known as vomitoxin). In addition, a given species \\ncan produce several different toxins, and grain crops are often \\ncontaminated by several Fusarium species at the same time. Thus, \\nseveral toxins may be present simultaneously in contaminated \\nfeeds.\\nMethods of controlling or decontaminating \\nmycotoxins\\nMycotoxins are regularly found in feed ingredients such as maize, \\nsorghum, barley, wheat, rice meal, cottonseed meal, groundnuts \\nand other legumes. In general, mycotoxins are relatively stable \\ncompounds that are not destroyed by processing of feed, and \\nmay even be concentrated by screening. Feeds contaminated \\nwith mycotoxins in excess of established levels should not be fed \\nto animals producing eggs or meat for human consumption. \\nIt is not easy to prevent mycotoxins in the environment. Pre-\\nvention of the contamination of agricultural commodities by \\nfungi and their mycotoxins can be divided into the following \\nthree levels.\\nPrimary prevention\\nThe best pre- or post-harvest strategy to use in a particular year \\ndepends on the climatic conditions of that year. Unfortunately, \\navoiding weather that favours fungal infection is beyond human \\ncontrol. Nonetheless, understanding the environmental factors \\nthat promote infection, growth and toxin production is the first \\nstep in minimizing mycotoxins in feeds. Several practices may help \\nto maintain conditions that are unfavourable for fungal growth: \\ni) development of fungal-resistant crop varieties; ii) control of on-\\nfield infection with fungicides; iii) scheduling of harvests in the \\nperiod suitable for the region; and iv) lowering the moisture con-\\ntent of the feedstuff after harvest and during storage.\\nSecondary prevention\\nThis level of prevention is required when the fungi are already \\nin the feedstuff. The fungi should be eliminated or their growth \\nstopped to prevent further deterioration and mycotoxin contami-\\nnation. The following measures may be useful: i) protecting stored \\nproducts from conditions that favour continuing fungal growth; \\nii) using mould inhibitors (such as organic acids) against fungal \\ngrowth; iii) storing commodity at low temperatures, where eco-\\nnomically possible; iv) stopping the growth of infested fungi by \\nre-drying the products; and v) removing contaminated material.\\nTertiary prevention\\nWhen the product is heavily infested by toxic fungi, primary and \\nsecondary prevention are no longer feasible. If the mycotoxin \\nlevels are known, it may be possible to dilute the contaminated \\nmaterial and produce a final blended feed that contains less than \\nthe critical level of the specific mycotoxin. Such blending of feeds \\nto reduce mycotoxin concentrations is officially permitted, with \\nrestrictions in several countries.\\nA number of additives are available for use in practical diets to \\nremove or detoxify mycotoxins and reduce their negative effects \\nvested products. The moisture content of the harvested product \\nand the ambient temperature are principal determinants of fun-\\ngal contamination and mycotoxin production. Some fungi, such \\nas Fusarium spp., normally infest grains before harvest; others, \\nsuch as Penicillium spp., invade after harvest, while Aspergillus \\nspp. can grow both before and after harvest. However, the pres-\\nence of fungi does not necessarily indicate contamination with \\nmycotoxins. \\nDifferent mycotoxins affect animals in different ways. Some \\nare cancer-causing toxins (e.g., aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, fu-\\nmonisin B1) and some are oestrogenic (zearalenones). Some af-\\nfect the nervous system (fumonisin B1), while others affect the \\nkidneys (ochratoxins) or suppress the immune system (aflatoxin \\nB1, ochratoxin A, and T-2 toxin). Depending on the degree of \\ncontamination, these effects will eventually have negative im-\\npacts on  performance. It is often difficult to diagnose the ef-\\nfects of a mycotoxin because they are not necessarily unique to \\na given mycotoxin, but may be shared by others or magnified by \\ninteractions with others. Many fungal species are also capable of \\nproducing several mycotoxins. Recent evidence has highlighted \\nthe co-contamination of feed samples with multiple mycotoxins, \\nwhich has serious consequences for both feed safety and animal \\nperformance. The hazards induced by the simultaneous presence \\nof several mycotoxins are not clearly understood.\\nIn addition, depending on the degree of contamination, myco-\\ntoxins or their metabolites can be deposited in meat, visceral or-\\ngans and eggs. Their concentration in animal products is consid-\\nerably lower than the levels present in the feed consumed by the \\nanimals, and will not cause acute toxicity in humans, but residues \\nof carcinogenic mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins and ochratoxin A, \\ncan affect human health. In most cases, however, the principal \\nsource of mycotoxins for humans is contaminated cereals and \\nlegumes rather than animal products. \\nAlfatoxins\\nAspergilli, the fungi producing aflatoxins, proliferate under condi-\\ntions of relatively high humidity and temperature, and are gener-\\nally regarded as storage fungi. Aflatoxin contamination is there-\\nfore almost exclusively confined to hot climates. Aflatoxin levels \\nin certain types of feeds (cereals and oilseed meals) are a major \\nproblem in tropical countries, and require careful monitoring and \\nappropriate treatment. All poultry species are susceptible to afla-\\ntoxin, especially young ducks. \\nOchratoxins\\nOchratoxins are produced by one Aspergillus species and two \\nPenicillium species. Both are storage species, but Aspergillus \\nthrives in hot, humid conditions, whereas Penicillium fungi are \\nessentially temperate. Ochratoxins are therefore problems in \\nboth tropical and temperate regions. Ochratoxin A and B are two \\nforms that occur naturally as contaminants, with A being more \\nubiquitous and occurring predominantly in cereal grains and the \\ntissues of animals fed with contaminated feedstuffs.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nFusarium mycotoxins\\nFusarium fungi are “field moulds”, as arable conditions (high \\nmoisture) favour their survival and growth. Fusarium fungi are \\nubiquitous, and cereal grains and animal feed are contaminated'),\n",

The birds are usually \\ngiven compounded feeds, and the larger facilities are normally \\nlocated close to urban areas. Indigenous stock are typically kept \\nby families in rural and sometimes peri-urban areas, in small semi-\\nscavenging flocks of ten to 30 birds, which are fed with house-\\nhold scraps and small amounts of other feed. Women and chil-\\ndren are usually responsible for managing family flocks (Sonaiya, \\nBranckaert and Gueye, 1999). \\nPerformance differences between the genotypes are often very \\nlarge.\\nCommercial layers developed from imported parent stock \\nhave the capacity to lay more than 300 eggs per year, while \\nindigenous hens often lay only 40 to 60 eggs per year (Sø-\\nrensen, in FAO, 2010). As well as the large difference in genetic \\npotential to produce eggs, a very significant cause of the five- to \\neightfold difference in annual egg production is the time – 17 \\nweeks – that a broody indigenous hen spends hatching a clutch \\nof eggs and rearing the chicks to about seven weeks of age. Dur-\\ning this time, she does not lay, which shortens the remaining time \\navailable for further egg production and means that she can pro-\\nduce only about 3.5 clutches per year.\\nQuantity and quality of feed is another significant factor in the \\ndisparity in annual egg production between the two genotypes. \\nCommercial genotypes are normally provided with carefully com-\\npounded feeds, which include nutrients in the correct propor-\\ntions for maximizing egg production. They are usually also fed \\nad libitum. The energy and protein intake of indigenous birds in \\nscavenging flocks is determined by the scavenging feed resource \\nbase, and is usually quite limited, particularly in the dry season. \\nTo maximize egg production, the capacity for broodiness \\nhas been bred out of commercial-strain layer hens. They \\nare therefore incapable of natural reproduction, and their \\nvalue in a village environment is thus quite limited.\\nThe growth rate of indigenous genotype chickens is also gener-\\nally much slower than that of commercial broilers. While broilers \\nunder typical confinement rearing may reach 2.0 kg live weight \\nat five weeks of age, indigenous-breed male birds often weigh no \\nmore than 1.0 kg at 20 weeks (Sørensen, in FAO, 2010). This is a \\nreflection of true genotype differences, but also of rearing envi-\\nronment, in which feed quantity and quality is the major factor.\\nDespite their lower productivity, in the village environment, the \\nindigenous genotype birds have a number of advantages:\\n• The hens become broody, so can reproduce without the need \\nfor artificial incubation and brooding.\\n• They are agile and can run fast, fly and roost in trees, so can \\nescape predators.\\n• They have been shown to be more resistant to bacterial and \\nprotozoan diseases and to parasitic infestations than com-\\nmercial broilers or layers are.\\n• Their meat and eggs are generally preferred to those from \\ncommercial birds, not only by rural communities but also of-\\nten by urban dwellers. \\nCommercial selection for meat and egg \\nproduction\\nThe dramatic gains in poultry meat and egg production from indi-\\nvidual birds in commercial flocks over the past 50 years are largely \\ndue to genetic selection in the nucleus breeding flocks of large \\nglobal poultry breeding companies and the rapid transfer of these \\ngains to the commercial cross-bred progeny.\\nThis has been facilitated by high reproductive rates, short gen-\\neration intervals, reduced environmental variation, large popula-\\ntion sizes to minimize the detrimental effects of inbreeding, and \\nthe use of several differentially selected sire and dam lines. \\nTo date, much of the improvement in performance has been \\nderived from the application of quantitative genetic selection, \\nwith limited use of molecular technologies.\\nThe large majority of commercial broilers and layers in develop-\\ning countries have been produced from imported grandparent or \\nparent stock originating from large global breeding companies. \\nThere are also a few smaller breeding operations that supply stock \\nto regional markets.\\nBroilers\\nThe continued annual productivity gains of commercial broiler \\nflocks are a reflection of the complex and coordinated approach \\nadopted by breeders to maximize performance. Breeders have \\nselected for such traits as growth rate, breast meat yield, food \\nutilization efficiency, skeletal quality, heart and lung function, and \\nlivability.

This has had profound positive impacts on the envi-\\nronment and on the availability and cost of poultry meat to \\nthe human population. \\nBreeders continue to pay attention to growth, feed efficien-\\ncy, meat yield, skeletal quality, general robustness and disease \\nresistance. \\nLayers\\nIn commercial flocks, egg number, size, shell and internal quality, \\nand layer livability, persistency of production and feed efficiency \\ncontinue to improve, owing to ongoing selection for these and \\ncorrelated traits. \\nCurrent average annual egg production is well in excess \\nof 300 eggs per hen, and continues to increase by more \\nthan one egg/hen/year, while the annual feed requirement \\nfor producing 300 eggs is declining by about 200 g/hen. \\nWith some 6 billion layer hens worldwide, this translates \\ninto savings of more than 1 million tonnes of feed per year. \\nAt present, layer breeding programmes focus on robustness \\nand disease resistance, as reflected in significant improvements \\nin livability and welfare. Considerable attention is also given to \\nuniform size and colour of eggs and to freedom from shell and \\ninternal defects.\\nBoth broiler and egg breeding programmes are now concen-\\ntrating on molecular marker-assisted selection (genomics). This \\napproach provides a means of identifying and selecting for or \\nagainst the genes affecting production traits, particularly those \\nthat are difficult to measure, and for the genes affecting disease \\nresistance.\\nGenetic approaches to improved \\nperformance in sub-optimal conditions\\nThe non-genetic factors mitigating against good performance \\nfrom poultry in developing countries typically include:\\n• high temperatures;\\n• sub-optimal nutrition;\\n• increased disease challenge;\\n• sub-optimal housing and management conditions.\\nAll genotypes are affected by these factors. Alongside efforts \\nto improve the physical environment, possible genetic approaches \\ninclude:\\n• selection in commercial genotypes for improved tolerance to \\nprevailing conditions;\\n• cross-breeding between commercial and indigenous geno-\\ntypes;\\n• introgression of genes from commercial genotypes, via back-\\ncrossing or cockerel exchange programmes;\\n• selection for improved performance in indigenous genotypes.\\nSelection in commercial genotypes\\nThe genetic stock from which the large majority of com-\\nmercial broilers and layers in developing countries are de-\\nrived was selected for production under relatively ideal \\nmanagement conditions in temperate climates. Little if any \\nemphasis has been given to tolerance to high temperatures \\nor to sub-optimal management and feeding conditions.\\nHigh ambient temperature is probably the main factor limit-\\ning the performance of commercial broilers and layers in medium \\nto large-scale production units in tropical developing countries. \\nOther factors can be addressed at moderate cost by establish-\\ning appropriate management strategies, but the cost of facilities \\nand the availability of a secure and reliable electricity supply make \\nshed cooling problematic.\\nA relatively simple approach to improving heat tolerance in \\ncommercial stock, without having to develop separate full selec-\\ntion lines, is to incorporate single genes affecting feather cover \\ninto the parent lines of stock to be used in high-temperature re-\\ngions. Reduced feather cover facilitates loss of body heat. Genes \\nshown to be effective in conferring heat tolerance include na-\\nked neck (Na), scaleless (sc) and frizzle (F) (Cahaner et al., 2008). \\nCommercial lines that express some of these genes are now avail-\\nable in some countries.\\nIrrespective of selection for heat tolerance, commercial \\nbroiler and layer genotypes require good management and \\nfeeding to realize their genetic potential for meat or egg \\nproduction. They are not capable of good performance un-\\nder semi-scavenging village conditions.\\nSeveral approaches have been used in efforts to incorporate \\nthe genes associated with superior egg and meat production in \\ncommercial strains into stock intended for use in less optimal envi-\\nronments. Such environments range from semi-scavenging village \\nproduction systems, where virtually the only inputs are household \\nscraps, through small-scale to medium-scale commercial opera-\\ntions, where birds are confinement-reared and fed with com-\\npounded diets, but are exposed to high ambient temperatures. \\nCross-breeding\\nIn many regions, local indigenous and commercial genotypes \\nhave been crossed in attempts to provide birds that are tolerant to \\nlocal conditions while also capable of reasonable performance. In \\nnearly all cross-breeding programmes, the cross-bred bird exhibits \\nconsiderably better egg production and/or growth rate than the \\nindigenous breed parent, but problems can be encountered with:\\n• loss of broodiness in hens, making them incapable of repro-\\nducing naturally;\\n• the need for maintaining separate parent lines/breeds and \\nfor the annual replacement of F1 cross-bred chicks;\\n• the need for additional inputs (particularly feed) to achieve \\nthe birds’ genetic potential for production;\\n• a change in appearance and “type”, which affects the birds’ \\nacceptability to farmers and the consumers of poultry eggs \\nand meat;\\n• erosion of the genetic resource.'),\n",

This can \\nbe achieved though back-crossing or cockerel exchange pro-\\ngrammes.\\nExperience has shown that for a back-crossing programme \\nto be sustainable, increasing levels of supplementary feed and \\nimproved management and disease control are required as the \\nfrequency of exotic genes increases. Cockerel exchange pro-\\ngrammes involve distributing cocks of improved breeds to small-\\nholders. However, several reports have concluded that this type \\nof improvement has not changed the basic populations, except \\nfor contributing to a larger variation in plumage colour (Besbes, \\n2008).\\nSelection within indigenous breeds\\nSelection for improved production within indigenous breeds or \\necotypes is problematic for the following reasons:\\n• Effective selection depends on accurate recording of pedi-\\ngree and performance.\\n• All birds should be subject to similar environmental variation.\\n• Egg production under cage confinement may be poorly cor-\\nrelated with reproductive performance under semi-scaveng-\\ning conditions.\\n• The components of reproduction under semi-scavenging \\nconditions are very complex, making selection under these \\nconditions exceedingly difficult.\\nDespite considerable genetic variation in most indigenous \\nbreeds for egg and meat production, the complexity of the pro-\\nduction system and of the desirable traits presents considerable \\nobstacles to effective selection for improved performance. There \\nare examples where performance has been improved through this \\napproach, but they are few and the gains have been modest (Sø-\\nrensen, in FAO, 2010).\\nGenetic diversity and conservation of \\ngenetic resources\\nThere is widespread concern in developing countries that as a re-\\nsult of replacement of low-producing breeds, urbanization, cross-\\nbreeding and the stamping out of flocks in response to outbreaks \\nof disease, the world is losing valuable and irreplaceable poultry \\ngenetic material. \\nConcerns about a loss in genetic variability in commercial \\npoultry strains have also been voiced following dramatic \\nglobal reductions in the number of commercial poultry \\nbreeders and the number of populations under selection \\nover the last 20 years (Arthur and Albers, 2003). A major con-\\ncern is that the reduced genetic variability could place the \\nindustry in jeopardy in the event of a major disease out-\\nbreak involving new virus strains.\\nThe State of the World’s Animal Genetic Resources, pub-\\nlished by FAO, found that of 2 000 avian breeds for which \\ndata were available, 30 percent were reported at risk, 35 \\npercent not at risk, and the remainder were of unknown \\nrisk status (Hoffmann, 2008). \\nIn the past, genetic diversity was largely determined by phe-\\nnotype. Recently, DNA analysis has provided an invaluable new \\ntechnology for determining the relationships among individu-\\nals, breeds and ecotypes. Clustering methods using microsatel-\\nlite markers have been effectively applied to assign individuals \\nto their breed of origin, and to determine the degree of genetic \\ndiversity between populations.\\nRecent studies have shown a large range of within-breed \\nor ecotype heterozygosities, of 28 percent for a fancy \\nbreed, 40 percent for white-egg layers, 45 to 50 percent \\nfor brown-egg layers, 50 to 63 percent for broilers, and 67 \\npercent for a population of village chickens (Tixier-Boichard, \\nBordas and Rognon, 2008). \\nStudies in Africa have suggested that village chickens do not \\nseem to exhibit a typical breed structure. While there is a high \\ndegree of between-bird variation in a village, differentiation be-\\ntween populations is observed only among those separated by \\nlarge geographical distances. There is therefore considerable \\nexchange of birds among adjacent villages. This suggests that \\nmany countries’ claims to have a significant number of breeds or \\necotypes of indigenous village-type chickens in a region may well \\nbe found by molecular measures to be based on a minimal degree \\nof genetic diversity. \\nAn integrated approach to breed characterization is required, \\nand data on production systems, phenotypes and molecular \\nmarkers should be combined to facilitate this. A comprehensive \\ndescription of production environments is needed, to improve un-\\nderstanding of the comparative adaptive fitness of specific animal \\ngenetic resources. \\nThe characterization of defence mechanisms against patho-\\ngens should be a priority, given the significance of the threats \\nposed by epizootics and climate change. Field and on-station \\nphenotypic characterization is therefore highly desirable. \\nREFERENCES\\nArthur, J.A. & Albers, G.A.A. 2003.

These birds are invariably \\nindigenous genotypes, or cross-breeds with a significant indig-\\nenous genotype component.\\nBecause chickens account for more than 90 percent of the total \\npoultry population in most countries, and because only limited \\ninformation on other poultry species is available, the following \\ndiscussion focuses on chickens.\\nIn most countries, flocks of indigenous breed birds are not \\nfound in significant numbers in urban or peri-urban areas, ow-\\ning to the lack of scavenging opportunities. In some countries, \\nthere are restrictions on small-scale scavenging flocks in urban \\nand peri-urban areas, because of the risk of disease transmission \\n(particularly HPAI) to the human population and to commercial \\npoultry flocks.\\nThe retention of indigenous poultry breeds\\nTheir low productivity raises the question as to why indigenous \\nchicken genotypes in rural regions have not been replaced by \\ncommercial genotypes. There are several reasons for this:\\n• Most indigenous genotypes still go broody, and can thus hatch \\ntheir own eggs without recourse to artificial incubation and \\nhatching, which are necessary for nearly all commercial geno-\\ntypes.\\n• Most indigenous breed hens have strong mothering instincts \\nand rear their young up to an age when they can fend for \\nthemselves under a scavenging management system.\\n• Most indigenous chicken genotypes are light-bodied, alert and \\ncan run fast and fly. They are thus more able to escape from \\npredators than commercial genotypes, particularly meat chick-\\nens.\\n• In most countries, the meat and eggs from indigenous geno-\\ntypes are generally preferred to those from commercial broilers \\nand layers, not only by rural but also often by urban dwellers, \\nwho will pay a premium for these products. \\n• Indigenous genotypes have been shown to be more heat-toler-\\nant and resistant to bacterial and protozoan diseases and para-\\nsitic infestations than commercial broilers or layers.\\n• Commercial broilers and layers perform far less well under \\nscavenging than under commercial confinement rearing and \\nfeeding conditions. This poor performance and the cost of \\nchicks make it uneconomic to rear commercial broilers under \\nscavenging conditions.\\n• Although most regions have significant numbers of sector 3 \\nsmall-scale commercial confinement rearing and feeding op-\\nerations with broilers or layers, the cost and risk associated with \\nsetting up and operating such enterprises are prohibitive for \\nmost poor rural families.\\nThe performance of indigenous genotypes improves under \\ncommercial confinement rearing and feeding conditions, but \\ngenerally not to an extent that makes production economically vi-\\nable, mainly owing to the cost of compounded feed. However, if \\nthe premium paid for eggs and meat is sufficiently high, this form \\nof management in medium-sized units can be justified. This is to \\nsome extent self-limiting, because if the market is flooded with \\nindigenous meat and eggs, the premium paid for them will fall.\\nContribution to domestic production and \\nconsumption of chicken meat and eggs\\nThe poor productivity of indigenous birds means that their total \\ncontribution to poultry meat and egg production and consump-\\ntion is considerably lower than their numerical contribution to \\nthe overall poultry population. However, because of their large \\nnumbers, their estimated contribution to meat consumption can \\nbe quite high in many countries (Pym, Guerne Bleich and Hoff-\\nmann, 2006).\\nBased on published reports of flock structures, productivity \\nand egg management in several countries, a study to estimate \\nindigenous chickens’ contribution to the overall consumption of \\nchicken meat and eggs found that in countries where indigenous \\nbirds comprised about 80 percent of the total chicken population, \\nadult indigenous breed hens accounted for about 20 percent of \\nthe total chicken population The study assumed that broilers and \\nlayers each made up about 10 percent of the standing popula-\\ntion, that layers were replaced annually, and that there were four \\nbatches of broilers per year. \\nThe study then estimated indigenous chickens’ contribution to \\negg and meat consumption, based on:\\n• average egg production of between 40 and 60 eggs/hen/year \\nfrom 3.5 clutches per bird;\\n• the preference in most communities for hatching the eggs to \\nproduce chicks, rather than eating the eggs;\\nContribution of indigenous genotypes to \\nproduction and consumption of poultry \\nmeat and eggs\\nRobert Pym, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, 4343, Queensland, Australia'),\n",

This makes it difficult for smaller breed-\\ning operations to compete effectively with large global breeding \\ncompanies, although smaller breeding companies are viable sup-\\npliers to niche markets in some areas.\\nBroiler breeding programmes\\nIn commercial broiler breeding programmes, selection addresses \\nthe following areas:\\n• Feed utilization efficiency: As feed accounts for about 70 per-\\ncent of production costs, the efficiency with which birds con-\\nvert feed to body weight is an important trait for direct selec-\\ntion. To enable the selection of birds from the same conditions \\nas their progeny are expected to perform in, some breeding \\ncompanies have started to replace single-bird cage selection \\nwith selection of individual birds from group floor housing, us-\\ning transponders on the birds and feeding stations to record \\nfood consumption.\\n• Breast meat yield: Because of the relatively high price of breast \\nmeat in developed countries, considerable efforts have been \\ndirected towards improving this trait.

Selection based on oximetry \\nand plasma levels of the cardiac-derived troponin-T enzyme \\nwas demonstrated to be effective in reducing susceptibility to \\nascites, and this procedure has been adopted by commercial \\nbroiler breeders. Levels of ascites in the field are now greatly \\ndecreased, even at high altitudes.\\n• Skeletal abnormalities: The very rapid growth rate of broiler \\nchickens puts an enormous strain on their immature cartilagi-\\nnous skeletons, resulting in high incidence of leg and skeletal \\nabnormalities. Selection based on gait, morphology and X-ray \\nimaging has done much to reduce the expression of conditions \\nsuch as tibial dyschondroplasia, spondylolisthesis and valgus \\nand varus deformation in most commercial strains of broilers, \\nbut skeletal abnormalities continue to be a major focus in most \\nbreeding programmes. \\nTo permit the transmission of genetic improvement from the nu-\\ncleus breeding populations (where all selection takes place) to the \\nbillions of cross-bred commercial broilers, significant multiplication \\nthrough grandparent and parent populations is needed, as shown \\nin Figure 1. The time lag between selection in the nucleus lines and \\ngains in the commercial broiler is typically about four years.\\nLayer breeding programmes\\nIn commercial layer breeding programmes, selection addresses \\nthe following areas:\\n• Egg production and size: Genetic improvement in egg produc-\\ntion and size is challenged by the highly canalized nature of the \\ntrait as determined by diurnal photoperiodic constraints; nega-\\ntive genetic correlations between egg production and early \\negg size; variation in the rate of increase in egg size with age; \\nand the need to predict persistence of lay in birds selected for \\nbreeding before the third phase of production. High-capacity \\ncomputers and sophisticated statistical packages involving Best \\nLinear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) procedures have been used \\nto predict persistence in the laying performance of birds in \\ncurrent flocks, allowing selection to take place earlier and the \\nmaintenance of a relatively short generation interval. \\n• Egg quality: Shell quality is defined in terms of strength, colour, \\nshape and texture; the first three have moderate to high herit-\\nabilities, so respond readily to selection. Shell colour is deter-\\nmined almost exclusively by genotype, and selection is typically \\nbased on measurement using reflectance spectophotometry. \\nThere are cultural preferences for eggs of different colours. \\nShell strength is a critical factor affecting profitability. Breeders \\nhave selected for improved shell strength by measuring shell \\nthickness, specific gravity (of fresh eggs), shell deformation, \\nand other indirect and direct parameters.

The greatest impact of this will be on dif-\\nficult-to-measure traits such as disease resistance and sex-limited \\ntraits, and those with low heritability. Large international poultry \\nbreeding companies have recently committed to a combined ini-\\ntiative to evaluate and implement genome-wide selection in their \\nrespective breeding programmes.\\nTransgenics: There are three approaches to producing trans-\\ngenic chickens: i) using viral vectors to introduce foreign DNA into \\nthe genome; ii) direct injection of DNA into the newly fertilized \\nzygote; and iii) using a cell-based approach to make modifications \\nto the genome.

However, most of these strains have been selected for \\nincreased productivity and general robustness under relatively \\ngood management and nutrition conditions, generally without \\nsignificant temperature stress. If they prove to be tolerant to sub-\\noptimal conditions it is usually owing more to chance than to di-\\nrected selection. To maximize performance, the companies often \\npromote improved management standards and practices in the \\ntarget countries. \\nGiven the very wide range of nutritional factors that affect per-\\nformance, large companies have not attempted to breed birds \\nwith tolerance to specific nutritional deficiencies, but a case could \\nbe made for selecting birds for increased tolerance to heat stress \\n(Cahaner, 2008). Heat stress has a marked impact on perfor-\\nmance, particularly the growth of broilers, owing to their high \\nmetabolic heat output. High temperatures are a feature of most \\ndeveloping countries, and maintaining reasonable house tem-\\nperatures is either too costly or simply not possible, owing to a \\nlimited or lacking power supply and other factors. As a result of \\nthis susceptibility to heat stress in broiler strains, it is standard \\npractice in many tropical developing countries to market the birds \\nat an early age and low weight, before heat stress becomes a \\nmajor problem.\\nGenotype-environment interaction\\nStudies have demonstrated genotype-environment interactions \\nby measuring the growth or egg laying performance of different \\nstrains when subjected either to good management, high-input \\nconditions or to harsh, low-input conditions (Besbes, 2008). Nu-\\ntrient intake is typically one of the major differences between the \\ntwo conditions. In almost all the cases studied, commercial stock \\nperformed considerably better than indigenous stock under good \\nconditions, but only marginally better, or the same, under low-\\ninput, harsh conditions (Tadelle, Alemu and Peters, 2000; Singh \\net al., 2004). \\nAn example of this is the comparison of egg laying perfor-\\nmance between Lohmann Brown and Sonali hens under optimal \\n(German Random Sample Test) and semi-scavenging conditions \\nFigure 1 \\nEffects of breed and environment interactions on egg production \\nSemi-scavenging\\nLohmann Brown\\nSonali\\nCage environment\\n100\\n150\\n200\\n250\\n300\\nEggs per 12 months\\nSource: Sørensen, 1999. \\nGenetic approaches to improved performance \\nin sub-optimal conditions\\nRobert Pym, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, 4343, Queensland, Australia'),\n",

The Sonali hens are F1 crosses between Rhode \\nIsland Red males and Fayoumi hens. Figure 1 shows the relative \\nperformances of the two strains in the two environments. The \\nLohmann Brown produced 303 eggs in 12 months under the op-\\ntimal conditions of the German Random Sample Test, but only \\n140 eggs under semi-scavenging conditions, where the Sonali \\nproduced 156. The Sonali was not tested under the German \\nRandom Sample Test, but its production was estimated at slightly \\nmore than 200 eggs (Sørensen, personal communication). \\nThere is therefore a persuasive argument for applying genet-\\nics to produce stock that perform well under the less than op-\\ntimal conditions prevailing in many developing countries. First, \\nhowever, any improved management conditions that have been \\ndemonstrated to result in improved performance and that are \\ncost-effective and sustainable should be applied, particularly \\nthose that improve the survival rate of young birds (confinement \\nearly rearing with the hen, with supplemental feeding and vac-\\ncinations), the supplemental feeding of growing and older stock \\nwith locally available feedstuffs, and ongoing disease prevention \\nmeasures. \\nBreeding for performance under sub-optimal \\nconditions\\nGiven the complex processes and inputs involved in genetic im-\\nprovement, there is little point in attempting to improve the per-\\nformance of a breed with inherently low production potential. \\nSelection of the breed(s) to use is therefore critical, and involves a \\ngood understanding of each breed’s specific attributes and a clear \\ndefinition of the breeding goals. \\nSmall-scale, semi-scavenging operations require dual-purpose \\nbirds that produce both eggs and meat. The opportunities for \\nselecting for improved egg production are limited by the hen’s \\nhatching each clutch of eggs and rearing the chicks to about six \\nor seven weeks of age before recommencing lay. The production \\nsystem is complex, and emphasis on one component could have \\nnegative repercussions on another. Two obvious requirements are \\nfor broodiness and mothering ability. Some breeds/ecotypes are \\nrenowned as good layers and mothers, and are thus suitable can-\\ndidate breeds, at least as the hens in any proposed cross-breeding \\nprogramme. It is rather more difficult to apply effective selection \\nat the individual bird level because of possible marked differences \\nin the impacts of nutritional and disease factors on individual \\nbirds’ performances. Nonetheless, there is a good case for culling \\npoor-performing hens, although there is often limited opportuni-\\nty to exert any selection pressure in smallholder situations, where \\nall surviving hens are needed to maintain flock size.\\nThe greater interest in meat than egg consumption in many de-\\nveloping countries justifies an emphasis on growth rate and body \\nconformation, in all stock in single-breed operations, and in males \\nin cross-breeding programmes. This should be balanced against \\nthe available feed resources. If the latter are limited, heavy body \\nweight may be a disadvantage, as the bird may obtain sufficient \\nnutrients to meet only maintenance requirements, with nothing \\nleft for growth.\\nIn small-scale commercial operations involving confinement \\nrearing and supplementary feeding, there is a persuasive argu-\\nment for using commercial improved breeds/strains of broilers or \\nlayers. However, their suitability depends on the level and quality \\nof feeding and the birds’ likely exposure to extreme climatic con-\\nditions. Where feeding is sub-optimal and commercial diets are \\neither not available or considered too expensive, there is a case \\nfor using local or other genotypes. One important factor is the \\nrelative prices paid for the meat and eggs produced by the dif-\\nferent genotypes. Where a significant premium is paid for meat \\nand eggs from indigenous breeds, the confinement rearing and \\nfeeding of these birds can be justified, in spite of their consider-\\nably lower productivity.\\nFor all small-scale production systems in tropical developing \\ncountries, tolerance to high temperature is a key requisite in the \\nbirds. One of the most effective ways of improving heat toler-\\nance is through the incorporation of single genes that reduce or \\nmodify feathering, such as those for naked neck (Na), frizzle (F) \\nand scaleless (Sc), as well as the autosomal and sex-linked dwarf-\\nism genes, which reduce body size (Cahaner et al., 2008). These \\ngenes are segregating in some indigenous populations, as there \\nis natural selection for heat tolerance as an important component \\nof reproductive fitness. There is also a good case for incorporating \\nthese genes into existing commercial lines, as the inputs and time \\nrequired for this are minimal compared with those required to \\ndevelop a high-producing, heat-tolerant line from a base popula-\\ntion (Cahaner, 2008).\\nBreeding approaches\\nCross-breeding\\nGenetic improvement can be achieved through cross-breeding, \\nwith or without genetic selection in the parent lines; through up-\\ngrading by repeated back-crossing to a superior parent breed; or \\nthrough within-line selection. The cross-breeding approach nor-\\nmally involves a two-way cross between an improved exotic and \\na local breed, with the aim of combining the better production \\ncapacity of the former with the latter’s adaptability to harsh envi-\\nronments. This system also maximizes the expression of heterosis, \\nor hybrid vigour, in the cross, normally reflected in improved fit-\\nness characteristics. \\nExamples of this approach are the Bangladesh and Indian cross-\\nbreeding programmes, which are described in some detail by Sø-\\nrensen (FAO, 2010). Briefly, the Bangladesh programme is based \\non crosses between Rhode Island Red (RIR) males and Fayoumi \\nfemales to produce the F1 Sonali cross-bred. RIR is a United States \\nbreed that has been used by many commercial breeding compa-\\nnies globally as the base population for their brown-egg lines; \\nFayoumi is an Egyptian breed with reasonable egg production \\nunder difficult environments, and is particularly known for its ge-\\nnetic resistance to disease. The cross-bred Sonali fowl has proved \\nto be the highest-yielding and most profitable breed combina-\\ntion in several comparisons under semi-scavenging conditions in \\nBangladesh (Rahman et al., 1997). \\nThe Indian programme is based on crossing Aseel breed males \\nwith CARI Red hens to produce cross-bred CARI Nirbheek hens. \\nThe native breed Aseel is well adapted to tropical conditions and \\nis known for its high majestic gate and dogged fighting qualities, \\nwhich make it capable of protecting itself against predators; the \\nfemale CARI Red has been selected for improved egg production \\ncapacity under tropical conditions. In the field, CARI Nirbheek \\nhens receiving about 30 g of supplementary feed per day were'),\n",

In both cases it is necessary \\nto retain separate populations of parent birds, and the progeny \\noften lose the capacity for broodiness, so cannot hatch or rear \\ntheir young. This is a major shortcoming given the purpose for \\nwhich the birds are being produced. In addition, the survival of \\nimproved breed males is often threatened by their lack of adapta-\\ntion to the environment and its dangers. Not the least of these \\ndangers is the attractiveness of these birds to other farmers, re-\\nsulting in frequent thefts for breeding or eating. These limitations \\nalso apply to cross-breeding programmes. \\nWithin-line selection\\nWithin-line selection for increased growth or egg production in-\\nvolves complex procedures that have to be undertaken at a cen-\\ntral breeding station (Besbes, 2008). The need for a sufficiently \\nlarge population, pedigree recording, accurate measurement of \\nindividual performance and the capacity to minimize environ-\\nmental variation makes it impossible for individual farmers to run \\nan effective selection programme. Even when the necessary re-\\nsources are available at a central breeding station, response is \\ngenerally slow, and the logistics for distributing selected stock to \\nfarmers pose considerable difficulties. Economies of scale are very \\nrelevant, as evidenced by the dramatic reduction in the number \\nof poultry breeding companies globally over the past 20 years. \\nThere is certainly need for stock with the capacity to perform \\nwell under the less than optimal environments typically encoun-\\ntered in developing countries. The link between performance and \\nnutritional and other management inputs means that any genetic \\nimprovement in performance capability must be matched by in-\\ncreased inputs. Genetic improvement through cross-breeding or \\nback-crossing undoubtedly results in improved egg and/or meat \\nproduction (provided it is accompanied by increased nutritional \\nand other management inputs), but account should be taken of:\\n• the increased complexity of running several different lines;\\n• the birds’ probable loss of broodiness and capacity to rear their \\nyoung;\\n• the impact that it may have on farmers’ interest in the chickens \\nand on consumers’ interest in their meat and their eggs. \\nAlthough within-line selection avoids most of these problems, \\nto be effective, it needs to be conducted at a central breeding sta-\\ntion, and to be well organized and funded. The choice of breed(s) \\nfor the base population is critical to the success of the enterprise. \\nREFERENCES\\nBesbes, B. 2008.

This is demonstrated by the huge \\nnumbers of chicken breeds and ecotypes found globally.\\nThe principal features of poultry that permit rapid increases in \\nthe numbers of breeds and ecotypes in all countries are their very \\nhigh reproductive rates and short generation intervals. Paradoxi-\\ncally, it is this capacity that now threatens the survival of many \\nearlier-developed breeds. The need for high production efficien-\\ncy, combined with the complexity and cost of running effective \\nbreeding programmes has resulted in commercially selected lines \\nof broilers and layers replacing several of the breeds previously \\nkept for productive purposes; over the past 20 years, there have \\nalso been dramatic reductions in the numbers of commercial \\nbreeding companies and genetic lines. \\nIn any discussion of genetic diversity, “breeds” are essentially \\ncultural concepts rather than physical entities. This is because \\nbreed standards have long been defined by phenotype, which \\nmay or may not involve significant differences in genotype. It is \\nonly recently that molecular tools capable of defining the de-\\ngree of genetic diversity between different breeds have been \\ndeveloped. It is therefore necessary to adopt a broad definition \\nof breed, until the term has been defined by a more objective \\nmeasure.\\n Poultry breeds can be categorized into several different group-\\nings according to present and past usage. Russell (1998) differ-\\nentiates poultry breeds as: industrial or commercial lines; breeds \\nused in traditional agriculture, historical breeds including old lan-\\ndraces; game breeds used primarily for cockfighting; ornamen-\\ntal breeds or those used mainly for exhibition; and experimen-\\ntal lines. Within these breeds there are many feather colour and \\ncomb variations (Simianer and Weigend, 2007), suggesting that a \\nhuge degree of genetic diversity is available, and posing questions \\nregarding how best to allocate the limited resources for conserv-\\ning this wide diversity as effectively as possible.\\nBreed categories and risk status\\nThere is currently considerable concern regarding the number of \\npoultry breeds that are either extinct or at risk of extinction. This \\ninformation has been obtained from the State of the World’s Ani-\\nmal Genetic Resources (FAO, 2007b), the first ever assessment of \\ndomestic animal diversity. The assessment process included up-\\ndating the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-\\nIS) global databank, which now contains breed-related informa-\\ntion on 16 avian species, with 3 505 country breed populations \\nand about 2 000 breeds. Chicken breeds make up the vast ma-\\njority (63 percent) of total avian breeds, followed by ducks (11 \\npercent), geese (9 percent) and turkeys (5 percent); indigenous or \\nlocal breeds make up most of the world’s poultry genetic diversity. \\nBreeds have been categorized according to whether they occur in \\none country (local), several countries in the same region (regional \\ntransboundary), or several regions (international transboundary). \\nThe proportions of each of these categories vary considerably \\nfrom region to region (see Hoffmann, 2008 for details).\\nAs noted by Hoffmann (2008), population data are frequently \\nmissing, which makes risk assessment extremely difficult. The ab-\\nsence of data is a result of the difficulties with monitoring small \\nlivestock and the general low importance that most governments \\nattribute to poultry, despite their important roles for food security, \\nrural livelihoods and gender equity. For 36 percent of reported \\navian breeds, the risk status is unknown; 35\\xa0percent are reported \\nas not at risk, and 30 percent as at risk. Of 2 000 reported avian \\nbreeds, 9 percent – mainly chickens (83 percent) – were reported \\nas extinct (FAO, 2007b). Most of these extinct breeds were from \\nEurope (Figure 1). \\nThe regions with the highest proportions of avian breeds clas-\\nsified as at risk are North America, with 73 percent of total avian \\nbreeds, and Europe and the Caucasus, with 51 percent. Among \\nthe different avian species, the proportions of breeds at risk are \\n36 percent for chickens and turkeys, 31 percent for geese, and \\n25 percent for ducks.\\nConservation of poultry genetic resources\\nIndigenous poultry breeds’ importance for subsistence farmers \\nin many developing countries, combined with many consumers’ \\npreference for their eggs and meat, suggests that these genetic \\nresources are not under immediate threat. However, gradual ero-\\nsion of the genetic integrity of the stock, through cross-breeding \\nand upgrading programmes, is cause for concern. In addition, \\nthe actual genetic variation between so-called different breeds \\nof indigenous birds in neighbouring regions has sometimes been \\nshown to be minimal, owing to long-term exchanges of breeding \\nGenetic diversity and conservation of  \\ngenetic resources\\nRobert Pym, School of Veterinary Science, The University of Queensland, Gatton, 4343, Queensland, Australia'),\n",

Substantial genetic diversity among village \\nchicken populations is observed only in populations separated by \\nwide geographical distances (Tixier-Boichard, Bordas and Rog-\\nnon, 2008).\\nPoultry fanciers in developed countries play a vital role in the \\nretention of genetically diverse populations of poultry species. \\nThe high reproductive rate and short generation interval of most \\nspecies mean that viable breeding populations can be maintained \\nat reasonable cost. Most “pure breeders” are motivated by the \\npleasure that the stock and the breeding enterprise bring them, \\nbut they are without doubt a largely untapped and vital source \\nof avian genetic resources and diversity. These breeders and the \\nsmallholder poultry farmers in developing countries provide im-\\nportant means for the in vivo conservation of poultry genetic re-\\nsources.\\nRecently, poultry genetic resources have suffered significant \\nlosses due to the termination of commercial lines associated with \\nbreeding company take-overs and the global consolidation of \\ncommercial poultry breeding operations. There have also been \\nsignificant losses of experimental lines, most of which are gener-\\nated at research institutions; it is becoming increasingly difficult to \\nfind the funds necessary for retention of these lines. \\nAs well as in vivo conservation, genetic material is also con-\\nserved in vitro, mainly through cryo-preservation of semen. Under \\nthis approach, repeated back-crossing is required to re-establish \\na breed, which may take up to seven generations. In addition, \\nthe original genome of the lost breed can never be fully restored \\nthrough this approach, owing to the loss of mitochondrial DNA. \\nAlthough cryo-conserved embryos allow the complete re-estab-\\nlishment of a breed, this is not possible for avian species at pre-\\nsent. Cryo-conservation of isolated embryonic cells, primordial \\ngerm cells or blastoderm cells may be an option in the future, \\nbut is currently too costly for genetic conservation programmes \\n(Hoffmann, 2008).\\nConservation programmes\\nFrom the FAO database, it is estimated that about 25 percent \\nof chicken breeds are included in conservation programmes, but \\nthere is no information about the nature or efficiency of these \\nprogrammes. According to country reports to FAO, only 15 per-\\ncent of countries (half of them developing countries) have poul-\\ntry conservation programmes (in vivo and in vitro), covering 63 \\npercent of local breeds and 11 percent of national populations \\nof transboundary breeds. The Global Databank shows that 195 \\npoultry breeds (of which 77 percent are chickens, 9 percent \\nducks, 9 percent geese and 3 percent turkeys) have conservation \\nprogrammes, but some of these data are out of date. Hoffmann \\n(2008) provides details of country-specific programmes that may \\nnot be recorded in the Global Databank.\\nMeasuring genetic diversity\\nRecently, there has been a major shift from the differentiation of \\npoultry breeds according to morphological and feather colouring \\ncharacteristics, to differentiation based on measurements at the \\nmolecular level. The use of molecular markers can provide quan-\\ntified criteria for assessing genetic diversity, either within or be-\\ntween populations. However, although they can be used to study \\nrelatedness between populations, provide information on past \\nhistory of populations, detect introgressions and contribute to the \\ngenetic definition of a breed’s entity, molecular markers do not \\nprovide information on phenotypes and special adaptive traits.\\nAppropriate sampling is critical to the molecular characterization \\nof a breed for comparative purposes; a minimum of between \\n30 and 50 individuals is required.

Bagust, Department of Avian Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne, Australia\\nIntroduction\\nIn the last half century, significant increases in the productivity \\nof modern poultry stocks have been achieved for both the meat \\nand the egg production sectors of the global poultry industry. \\nSynergies have resulted from advances made in all the major ac-\\ntivities of poultry management and housing, nutrition and ration \\nformulation, applying poultry genetics knowledge in commercial \\nbreeding programmes and better diagnosis and control of avian \\ndiseases. Of all these core elements, poultry health and disease \\ncan be the least predictable.\\nAlthough poultry diseases from nutritional and metabolic caus-\\nes can be of concern, the emphasis in this information note is on \\ncontrolling diseases that are caused by infectious agents, which \\ncan exert damaging – and sometimes immediate – negative ef-\\nfects on the profitability of commercial operations. The develop-\\nment of an intensive poultry industry in many of the countries \\ndiscussed here depends on the growth in number and size of \\nsmall and medium-sized commercial poultry operations. The em-\\nphasis in this review is therefore primarily on optimizing poultry \\nhealth for this scale of operations. Because of the importance \\nof small-scale village-based production units in many developing \\ncountries, however, the poultry health implications for and from \\nsuch flocks are also included.\\nPoultry diseases: pathogens and their costs \\nto production systems\\n• Pathogens are disease-causing microorganisms, and include \\nvarious bacteria, viruses and protozoa. \\n• A specific pathogen is a microbe that is able to cause a spe-\\ncific disease following inoculation of a susceptible host chicken \\nwith a purified culture. For example, avian health research has \\nshown that ILT virus is the sole cause of the poultry respiratory \\ndisease syndrome recognized in the field as infectious laryn-\\ngotracheitis (ILT), while the bacterium Pasteurella multocida is \\nthe specific cause of another respiratory disease known as sub-\\nacute fowl cholera. \\n• “Although the relative importance of poultry diseases may dif-\\nfer between countries and geographical areas, there are few \\nimportant diseases that are unique to particular parts of the \\nworld” (Biggs, 1982).\\n• At the global level, however, differences in distribution among \\nregions are now apparent, because genetic variants have \\nemerged within some of the major specific pathogens of chick-\\nens. This has become important for attempts to prevent the \\nspread of virulent strains through international movements of \\npoultry products. Table 1 shows the regional distribution of dif-\\nferent biotypes of some important pathogens in 2008. Inter-\\nregional variation in the distribution of pathogen strains \\nof higher virulence will become more significant in trade, \\nas the poultry industries of developing countries enter \\nexport markets.\\nAvian pathogens in the future\\nEmerging pathogens are those for which recognition continues to \\noccur over time (see Information Note on “Emerging Pathogens \\nof Poultry Diseases).

These pathogens possess \\ninherent properties of high transmissibility, and have enhanced \\nresistance to inactivation (loss of infectivity) due to environmen-\\ntal temperature and sunlight. Such pathogens therefore tend to \\noccur more frequently on poultry sites. Table 2 summarizes the \\nmajor route(s) of transmission for each of the major pathogens. \\nKnowing the means of spread of any pathogen is fundamental \\nto the development of a plan of action to prevent spread of the \\npathogen and outbreak of the disease within a production site.\\nThe poultry diseases listed in Table 2 are those likely to be \\ncaused by a single specific pathogen. Competent avian veterinar-\\nians and the technical personnel who undertake poultry health \\nservicing for farmers in a modern poultry industry must be able \\nto identify or at least suspect these diseases in their classical or \\nrelatively uncomplicated forms. \\nFurther disease effects \\nRespiratory disease complex: Under field conditions, pathogens \\noften interact with not only the host (bird) and its environment, \\nbut also one another. For example, day-old chicks arriving infect-\\ned from the hatchery (vertical transmission) and remaining chroni-\\ncally infected for life are susceptible to other respiratory diseases \\nsuch as infectious bronchitis or Newcastle disease. Fine dust parti-\\ncles in the poultry house air can then combine with superinfection \\nby Escherichia coli bacteria contribute to additional respiratory in-\\nsults, which will produce the (multiple) lesions that are seen at \\nautopsy for complex respiratory disease. Field disease interactions \\noften also involve common immunosuppressive agents, such as \\ninfectious bursal disease, Marek’s disease or chicken infectious \\nanaemia viruses. These increase the complexity of the disease pic-\\ntures clinically and the lesions observable at autopsy. \\nImmunosuppression significantly decreases the ability of young \\npoultry to respond effectively to standard vaccinations, and also \\npredisposes them to infection by other specific pathogens. How-\\never, sub-clinical immunosuppression is often not readily appar-\\nent to the farmer, and therefore a common “silent” cause of \\nsignificant economic losses. Pathogens causing such infectious \\ndisease conditions are termed “erosive” for site productivity \\n(Shane, 2004). In contrast, major pathogens with high death \\nrates and rapid spread such as NDV, IBDV or HPAI, although ge-\\nnerically termed “catastrophic” diseases, cause lower economic \\nlosses in the longer term than the lower-level but more pervasive \\nand widespread erosive pathogens do. Immunosuppression re-\\nsults from a range of known infectious and non-infectious causes, \\nas shown in Table 3. \\nTo diagnose the cause(s), competent autopsies combined with \\nsystematic on-site investigations of flock production, vaccination \\nhistory and management practices need to be undertaken. How-\\never, results from laboratory examinations will often be needed \\nto confirm a diagnosis. The Information Note on “Poultry Disease \\nDiagnosis: Field Skills and Laboratory Procedures” gives further \\ndetails.\\nIn the context of poultry health and disease control, the gov-\\nernment of a country that aims to develop a sustainable \\nmodern poultry industry MUST THEREFORE also put in \\nplace competent field and veterinary laboratory capacity \\nfor the diagnosis of poultry diseases. There is a strong need \\nnetic mechanisms, including mutation, recombination or co-evo-\\nlution with vaccines (e.g., Marek’s disease virus) or the medica-\\ntions used (e.g., coccidiostats). There is a very high probability \\nthat several new poultry pathogens will emerge during the \\nnext ten to 20 years. The most likely candidates are pathogenic \\nvariants of avian ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, specifically those \\ncausing infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease, infectious bursal \\ndisease and avian influenza, as well as a hypervirulent form of \\nMarek’s disease caused by an avian DNA (herpes-) virus, which \\nis arguably the most challenging disease to control in intensive \\npoultry industries worldwide. \\nDeveloped poultry industries are characterized by on-site bi-\\nosecurity programmes, which are designed to prevent or mini-\\nmize incursions by known infectious diseases. These programmes \\nare supported by close veterinary and laboratory surveillance for \\npoultry health. A newly emergent disease can therefore most \\nlikely be recognized quickly in any developed poultry industry. \\nHowever, in countries where poultry production sites still \\nlack adequate biosecurity programmes and access to com-\\npetent veterinary services with laboratory backup, the eco-\\nnomic consequences and time needed to identify, control \\nand resolve the problem are much greater. The danger is that \\none or more emerging pathogens become established within a \\ncountry’s poultry populations and then continue to pose a threat \\nas an endemic infection. \\nThe costs of diseases within a country’s poultry \\nindustry \\nUsing figures from the United States, Biggs (1982) reported that \\nthe total economic costs of disease (including vaccines and con-\\ndemnations) were about 20 percent of the gross value of produc-\\ntion (GVP) and about three times the cost of losses from mortal-\\nity. An analogous 2007 analysis conducted by the University of \\nGeorgia, United States, calculated that the GVP of the United \\nStates poultry industry in 2005 was US$28.2 billion, and disease \\nlosses were 8.2 percent of this. Both studies showed that for each \\nUS$1\\xa0000 loss due to mortalities, another US$2 000 is lost else-\\nwhere owing to depressed productivity resulting from disease.\\nThere is little information on the economic consequences of \\npoultry diseases in developing counties. Hence one of the future \\nchallenges for these industries will be to organize the health in-\\nfrastructure needed to conduct such analysis. Another will be to \\nmove from using frank mortality rates as an economic indicator \\nof losses, to accounting for and then countering the high losses \\nof productivity that result from health-related sub-optimal pro-\\nduction.\\nInfrastructural capacity to diagnose the main causes of \\ndisease losses accurately will therefore prove necessary for \\ncountries seeking to develop a sustainable poultry industry.\\nPoultry pathogens and their major means \\nof transmission among poultry production \\nsites\\nTable 2 lists 25 of the major infectious poultry diseases world-\\nwide. Based on World Organisation for Animal Health listings \\n(OIE, 2000), these are recognized globally as the diseases of most \\nconcern, because of their economic effects on commercial poul-\\ntry production and their potential for negative effects on trade.'),\n",

For further and pathogen-specific protection measures, the \\nfarmer will also need to have correctly applied vaccination pro-\\ngrammes for the dangerous (catastrophic) poultry pathogens that \\nare known to be active in that region, such as Newcastle disease \\nvirus and virulent infectious bursal disease virus strains. Through \\nthis, disease outbreaks can largely be prevented, even if such \\npathogens gain entry to the site. A second tier of vaccinations – \\nsuch as against some major immunosuppressive and respiratory \\ndisease agents (profit-erosive) – is also highly desirable. For poul-\\ntry disease control, the most common problem on sites in many \\ndeveloping countries is their overreliance on vaccinations, rather \\nthan investing to achieve effective site biosecurity. The primary \\napproach to poultry health on a production site should be to at-\\ntempt to EXCLUDE diseases, rather than allowing relatively ready \\nentry of a pathogen to flocks and then attempting to reduce its \\neffects by immunoprotection, i.e., vaccination.\\nPoultry health: network building in a \\ndeveloping country. \\nWhy should a network approach be taken to poultry health? \\nBecause the real challenge for a developing country is \\nto build sustainable poultry disease control systems that \\ncan focus and integrate their available professional poultry \\nhealth resources. Although personal and political networks are \\noften strong, professional health networking and the sense that \\nindustry personnel are working with the government sector to \\nachieve common agreed aims can be much less evident. Frag-\\nmentation and duplication of resources and services, along with \\ndisagreements as to which (and how) areas of weakness must be \\nstrengthened, can mean that little real improvement of overall \\npoultry health is achieved.\\nA distinguishing feature of the poultry health services in de-\\nveloped countries is the regular exchange of information among \\nindustry veterinarians (although their companies will be com-\\nmercial competitors), government health services (laboratory and \\nfield) and often the universities in a region. Such communication \\nand cooperation occur regularly, for example, quarterly within a \\nsoundly developed industry, because it is recognized that the mu-\\ntual benefits of communicating about poultry health matters far \\noutweigh the collective losses from silence. \\nHow can the government agencies of a developing country \\nposition themselves to accelerate the development of a poultry \\nindustry? \\nExperiences gained in developed poultry industries worldwide \\nhave demonstrated that investing State resources in a central \\npoultry health facility/unit with designated functions can \\nprovide an integrated special-purpose vehicle for delivering avian \\nhealth-in-production services, as illustrated in Figure 1.\\nGovernment agencies and all industry stakeholders stand to \\nbenefit. Interaction between government and industry rep-\\nresentatives is therefore essential for successful design and \\nplanning, and also later, when periodically reviewing the unit’s \\nperformance in health and disease control. Industry might well \\ncontribute to financing this, for example, by providing funding for \\nmajor pieces of laboratory equipment or other infrastructure that \\nit expects will provide high benefit to itself. However, the guid-\\ning principle must be to achieve focused and integrated health \\nfunctions for the unit to produce the health outputs needed to \\nsupport sustainable poultry production in the developing country \\nconcerned. Avian veterinarians should also have pivotal roles in \\nthe poultry industry, through protecting both poultry and human \\nhealth (see Information Note on “Veterinary Roles in Health and \\nKnowledge Transfer across a Poultry Industry”).\\nThe primary thrust for senior government personnel, in part-\\nnership with industry, should be the planning of human resources \\nto strengthen laboratory and extension skills for integrated ac-\\ntivities that can deliver appropriate health services across the four \\nsectors of the country’s poultry industry. Proof of success will be \\nvisible evidence of the private sector choosing to use government \\nservices.\\n Investment in the construction of large purpose-built buildings \\nor a stand-alone new facility should not be seen as the primary \\naim of this exercise. However, some low-cost special-purpose \\nadditions to an existing laboratory may significantly enhance \\nthe functional capacity of that unit. Examples could include the \\nstrengthening of microbiological health surveillance, or a simple \\nbuilding for secure maintenance of a small specified pathogen-\\nfree (SPF) poultry flock. Production of SPF eggs and chickens can \\nthen enhance local investigations, including with experimental \\nreproduction of field diseases.\\nThe overriding goal for the central poultry services unit \\nis to be accessible and cost-effective for the veterinary and \\ntechnical personnel who service commercial poultry pro-\\nduction operations, particularly small and medium-sized \\nfarming enterprises. The modus operandum should be fee-\\nfor-service.\\nThere will however be a clear responsibility for the services \\nprovider to direct and develop its staff resources adequately, to \\nensure that the services offered are relevant to the needs of the \\ndeveloping industry. The interfacing of industry and government \\npoultry health production activities can then help to drive both \\n(Bagust, 1999; Information Note on “Veterinary Roles in Health \\nand Knowledge Transfer across a Poultry Industry”). For develop-\\ning countries, there is another interesting development prospect: \\nif government laboratory-based services are of sufficient quality, \\nthe large-scale intensive industrial operators (Sector 1 in Figure 1) \\nmay choose to pay for using those services.

Bagust, Department of Avian Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne, Australia\\nWhat is an emerging pathogen and how is it \\nrecognized?\\nEmerge = “to come forth into view from concealment or obscu-\\nrity in background”. (Macquarie Dictionary, Macmillan publishers)\\nAs opposed to a specific pathogen that is known to be present \\nas the cause of a recognizable poultry disease, an emerging path-\\nogen is a specific microbe that can be shown to be the causative \\nagent of a disease that:\\ni.\\t has been recognized previously, but the cause has remained \\nunclear; or \\nii.\\tis a new disease syndrome that has not appeared previously.  \\nThe usual sequence of events in the emergence of a disease \\ngenerally starts with a novel disease becoming apparent to indus-\\ntry veterinarians and supporting diagnostic laboratories in a coun-\\ntry, or sometimes simultaneously in several countries. Serological \\nand virological investigations will often exclude the obvious in-\\nvolvement of currently known poultry pathogens. If the disease \\nlosses caused by this new pathogen are likely to be significant, \\nfurther investigations will be undertaken in the research labora-\\ntory to clarify the pathogenesis of infection, means of transmis-\\nsion, immunity mechanism, and potential for vaccine develop-\\nment or eradication, depending on which is the most appropriate \\napproach.\\nCultivation of the microbial agent outside the host will usually \\npermit serological screening to establish the prevalence of infec-\\ntion in flocks. Diagnostic investigations may include retrospective \\nstudies of previously unresolvable field disease problems, such as \\navian leukosis (subgroup-J) (Example 1). \\nThe nature and intensification of the poultry industry make it \\nseem likely that high numbers of specific pathogens will have \\nto be excluded or prevented by vaccination at production sites, \\nand that many pathogens will have arisen or been recognized as \\nemerging in recent decades.\\nThe industry is not unique in this regard among the intensive \\nanimal industries (pigs, poultry and fish), but pathogen-host dy-\\nnamic interactions occur on a huge scale and are frequent within \\nthe poultry industry globally. Among production animal species, \\npoultry have a uniquely short generation interval and must be re-\\nproduced continually, with probably about 100 million individual \\nanimals a day across the world’s poultry industries. Vaccination is \\nan essential measure for protecting poultry stocks against a range \\nof dangerous pathogens, and during this protection process, the \\nhost’s immunity continually exerts selection pressure on these \\npoultry pathogens.\\nViral pathogens, particularly those with ribonucleic acid (RNA) \\ngenomes (e.g., infectious bronchitis, Newcastle disease, infec-\\ntious bursal disease viruses, and avian retroviruses such as avian \\nleukosis virus), are all susceptible to the development of point \\nmutations during replication of the genome. These viruses ap-\\npear to lack effective proof-reading mechanisms for control of \\nviral translation and repair of mutations during replication. Payne \\n(2001) estimates that the rate of point mutations in avian retro-\\nviruses is as high as one per million virions, occurring within just \\none twelve-hour cycle of replication.\\nAs viruses are continually mutating, so it must be accept-\\ned that new virus strains and disease problems will emerge \\nin the future.\\nSeveral examples of poultry pathogens that have emerged in \\nthe last decade or so are given in the following, along with a brief \\nexplanation of the mechanism(s) involved in their emergence.\\nExample 1: Avian leukosis (subgroup-J) virus\\nThis pathogen developed by genetic recombination in the field \\nbetween two avian retroviruses. Between 1995 and 1998, neo-\\nplasms were observed in young breeders, leading to major losses \\nof broiler breeders worldwide. This was due to primary breed-\\ning companies having genetic stock contaminated with ALV-J, \\nthe progeny from which were then exported to more than 50 \\ncountries. Retrospective virological and serological examinations \\nby Payne (2001) and his laboratory group showed that this virus \\nwas circulating in the United Kingdom as early as 1989, with in-\\nfections in some flocks sporadically producing tumours then in \\nbroiler breeding stocks.\\nExample 2: Newcastle disease.\\nThe emergence of virulent NDV from lentogenic strains of New-\\ncastle disease in Australia from 1999 to 2001 has been closely in-\\nvestigated and scientifically proven using molecular epidemiology.\\nExample 3: Highly pathogenic avian influenza. \\nBecause of its zoonotic potential, the emerging poultry disease of \\ngreatest concern worldwide has been avian influenza, whether \\nHPAI H5N2 (China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \\nin 1999 and 2001) or HPAI H5N1 (in Asia from 2003 onwards, \\nspreading to some 60 countries worldwide). This pathogen has \\nsubsequently been eradicated from all developed poultry indus-\\ntries, but is persisting as an endemic infection of poultry in several \\ncontinents.'),\n",

Bagust, Department of Avian Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne, Australia\\nField skills \\nIt is extremely important to apply a systematic approach when \\nconducting field investigations. An autopsy (necropsy) is essential \\nfor avian veterinarians or technical services personnel seeking to \\nestablish a preliminary diagnosis. The autopsy also allows samples \\nto be collected and submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for con-\\nfirmatory testing. Samples collected may include blood, serum, \\nplasma, swabs, feathers, tissues, scrapings or smears, as needed \\nfor confirmation or exclusion of the potential causative patho-\\ngens. Excellent video-based information on practical procedures \\nfor clinical examination and sample collection can be accessed at \\nhttp://partnersah.vet.cornell.edu/. \\nTwo of the best general-audience articles available on flock \\nhealth and poultry diseases diagnosis were published in the in-\\nternational poultry industry technical periodical World Poultry \\n(Yegani , Butcher and Nilipour, 2005a; 2005b). These articles can \\nbe accessed directly by using the hyperlinks shown for each.\\nLaboratory procedures\\n The following comments confirm and extend the key information \\nin these two articles.\\nSerology is the most frequently used of the three diagnostic \\napproaches. However, it should be noted that detection of anti-\\nbody can only be an indicator of previous exposure to a patho-\\ngen. Serology is nearly ideal for application in flock health sur-\\nveillance, as laboratory testing can be conducted quite readily, \\nfor both the collection and the examination of large numbers of \\nsamples from multiple flocks. Serological activities in flock health \\nsurveillance may also include monitoring the effectiveness of vac-\\ncination programmes. \\nMicrobiological investigations – bacteriology and virol-\\nogy: Yegani, Butcher and Nilipour (2005b) explain briefly where \\nthese tests are used in the modern industry. The following are \\ntheir main advantages and disadvantages: \\nHistopathology is relatively economical, quick and useful for \\nobtaining results, and the samples are easy to collect, store, trans-\\nport and process. The downside of histopathology is that once a \\nset of samples has been placed in fixative, the culture and typing \\nof a pathogen is usually not possible. \\nMicrobiology, whether bacterial or viral, it is invaluable for \\nthe isolation and culture of pathogens. However, the practitioner \\nmust exercise care to avoid cross-contamination when collect-\\ning the samples, and to prevent inactivation of infectivity during \\ntransport to the laboratory. \\nRoutine aerobic bacterial culture is not expensive, other types \\nof culture and typing usually are.\\nCulture of avian viruses is sometimes required, especially when \\nfield disease presentations are atypical or the emergence of a vari-\\nant form of a viral pathogen (e.g., infectious bronchitis virus) is a \\npossibility. The disadvantages of virus culture are that it requires \\ntime – often about a week – and using culture systems is moder-\\nately expensive. \\nPCR (polymerase chain reaction): This test system is highly \\nsensitive and specific, which can be a problem. If the reagents \\n(e.g., the primers) used are not an exact match with the patho-\\ngen in question, false negatives will occur. False positives, through \\ncontamination while a test is in progress in the laboratory can also \\nbe a problem.\\nNote: No laboratory test can return perfect results every time, \\nand laboratories are not infallible. Veterinarians and technicians \\nshould always keep in mind the point made by Yegani, Butcher \\nand Nilipour:\\n“It is important, when investigating poultry production-\\nhealth problems, that you do NOT rely SOLELY on the re-\\nsults of diagnostic tests”. \\nReferences\\nMorrow, C. 2008.

Cleaning fol-\\nlowed by disinfection is essential between batches of poultry. \\nConcrete rather than earth flooring in poultry production areas \\ngreatly increases the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection. \\n•  Equipment should NOT be shared among poultry sites. If it is \\nabsolutely necessary to share items, the equipment must be \\nthoroughly cleaned AND disinfected before and after entering \\nany poultry production site.\\n• Contamination of food and water by faeces should be strictly \\navoided. \\n• Feed should be stored in secure, lidded containers; the water \\nsupply should be decontaminated, for example, by a standard \\nchlorination treatment.\\nBirds and health: \\n• Birds should be sourced from a breeder whose bird health sta-\\ntus is known to be good, and should be of healthy appearance \\non arrival at the site. The new birds being introduced should be \\nkept separate and be the last fed every day for an initial quar-\\nantine and observation period of one month.\\n• Potential signs of diseases, which should be known by the \\nfarmer, can include: \\n-- dullness, reluctance to drink or eat; \\n-- diarrhoea, respiratory distress, a sudden drop in egg produc-\\ntion;\\n-- inability to walk or stand, abnormal position of head, neck \\nor wings;\\n-- sudden illness and/or death of several of the birds in a group. \\nBiosecurity programmes are based primarily \\non quarantine of a site combined with \\nmeasures for stringent hygiene and \\ndisinfection.\\nThe strength of this approach is that it can be applied generally to \\nexclude from a site ALL important diseases (see Table 2 in “Poultry \\nHealth and Disease Control in Developing Countries”) apart from \\nthose that are egg-transmitted.\\nMore specialized disease prevention and control measures to sup-\\nport biosecurity on a site include:\\nVaccination and medication: Diseases for which these may \\nbe applied include almost all the ones listed. However in every \\ncase, the vaccine being used will be effective for the prevention \\nof ONLY that specific disease.\\nEradication can be applied for egg-transmitted pathogens \\nONLY.

The whole building represents the production site, and \\nthe pillars are the individual supporting activities that are inte-\\ngrated into an overall biosecurity programme.\\nThe pillars represent the major technology-based approaches \\ncurrently available for the control and prevention of infectious \\ndiseases of poultry. From left to right, the order of the pillars rep-\\nresents how widespread their use should be, starting with ap-\\nproaches that are suitable for widespread application, and mov-\\ning towards those that are suitable only for specific uses. Thus, \\nwhile quarantine, hygiene and disinfection are universally appli-\\ncable against poultry pathogens, vaccination can be widely, but \\nnot always, used and eradication is currently feasible only for a \\nfew pathogens.\\nPillar 1 – QUARANTINE: Currently, genetically based disease \\nresistance is rarely of practical use in the field. This means that \\nisolation is the only option. This is the oldest of the approaches, \\nand dates back to Roman times (quaranta is Latin for 40), when \\na 40-day isolation period was enforced before a plague ship crew \\ncould enter a harbour or town.\\nPillar 2 – HYGIENE AND DISINFECTION – complements quaran-\\ntine. When flocks are being isolated from the entry of microbes, \\nhygiene and cleaning are the first measures used. These must \\nresult in the removal of organic material from the surfaces \\nto be decontaminated, for example, in poultry houses or the \\nhatchery, if antimicrobial disinfection treatment is to be effective.\\nPillar 3 – VACCINATION is probably the easiest and most eco-\\nnomical group of methodologies used for the control and preven-\\ntion of poultry diseases in poultry production. However, it should \\nNOT be used as the sole measure on a flock.\\nPillar 4 – ERADICATION is a feasible disease control option for \\nonly some specific poultry pathogens. The criteria to be met are \\nusually that the major mode of transmission is via the egg and \\nthat relatively accurate and inexpensive lab tests have already \\nbeen developed for detection of infection. Although a successful \\neradication programme requires major investments of resources, \\nsignificant benefits can flow back to industry over the longer \\nterm.\\nPillar 5 – IMMUNOGENETIC RESISTANCE to disease is not yet \\ncomplete, but – as the case of Marek’s disease virus demonstrates \\n– it may soon become so. The solution may lie in the hands of \\ncommercial primary breeding companies, because genetic selec-\\ntion could be applied to disease resistance, should a commercial \\nneed create pressure for this. At present, however, this is not seen \\nas a high priority relative to other growth and production param-\\neters. In addition, there is a lack of effective tools for selecting \\nfor specific resistance to many major infectious poultry diseases.\\nBiosecurity Program\\n1. Quarantine\\n2.

Although \\nindustrialized countries have much higher average per capita \\nconsumption of most poultry products, production in develop-\\ning countries is increasing rapidly. In 2000, Compassion in World \\nFarming reported that average annual egg production in develop-\\ning countries had increased by 331 percent since 1980. \\nAlthough chickens are very different from people, it is thought \\nthat they are capable of suffering from states such as pain or \\nfrustration. Ethical consideration therefore needs to be applied \\nto poultry farming, and ways of ensuring good welfare for such \\nlarge numbers of animals need to be found. \\nWhat is animal welfare? \\nThe Oxford English Dictionary associates welfare with “well-be-\\ning; happiness; and thriving or successful progress in life”. In rela-\\ntion to animals, different cultures emphasize different aspects. \\nThus, people from different backgrounds give different relative \\nimportance to animal welfare factors such as: i) health and nor-\\nmal biological functioning; ii) the subjective “feelings” of the ani-\\nmals; and iii) the animals’ ability to live a natural life (EFSA, 2005). \\nThe World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) definition of an-\\nimal welfare refers to how well an animal is able to cope with the \\nconditions in which it lives (www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_\\nchapitre_1.7.1.htm). This definition, derived from Broom (1986), \\nhas widespread, but not universal, acceptance. Other authors \\ncontinue to emphasize the importance of animals’ feelings and \\nexperiences in their definitions of animal welfare (Phillips, 2009). \\nFor the purposes of this review, the concept of animal welfare \\nrefers to an animal’s overall state of well-being. OIE considers that \\ngood animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary \\ntreatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane \\nhandling and humane slaughter/killing. In general, many differ-\\nent components of an animal’s state must be considered to judge \\nwhether its welfare is good or bad. Some of the components that \\nFAO considers important are that the animal should be healthy, \\ncomfortable, well nourished, and safe. It is also important that \\nanimals are able to express behaviours that are priorities in a cap-\\ntive environment (Weeks and Nicol, 2006) and that they should \\nnot suffer from unpleasant mental states such as pain, fear and \\ndistress (although these feelings cannot be measured directly). \\nWhen considering animal welfare as a whole, it is important to \\ntake each of these components into consideration.\\nMeasuring animal welfare\\nThe state of an animal’s welfare can range from very good to \\nvery bad (Duncan and Fraser, 1997). Sometimes, however, one \\ncomponent of welfare is good but others are not. For example, an \\nanimal might be in good health but its ability to move may be re-\\nstricted by caging or tethering. It is therefore important to be able \\nto measure each component of welfare, and to devise ways of \\nintegrating the different measures to reach an overall conclusion. \\nThe Five Freedoms, principles and criteria for good \\nwelfare\\nIn the United Kingdom, the welfare of farm animals has been \\nconsidered a formal discipline since 1965, when the Brambell \\nCommittee suggested that farmed animals should have five basic \\n“freedoms” of movement, such as the freedom to stretch and \\nthe freedom to turn around. These can be considered the original \\ncomponents of animal welfare. However, they are rather narrow, \\nso to take account of a broader range of animals’ physical and \\nbehavioural needs, these Five Freedoms were modified in 1979 \\nby the United Kingdom’s Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC, \\n1979), which proposed that all farm animals should have:\\n1.\\tfreedom from hunger and thirst;\\n2.\\tfreedom from discomfort;\\n3.\\tfreedom from pain, injury and disease;\\n4.\\tfreedom to express normal behaviour; \\n5.\\tfreedom from fear and distress.\\nThe Five Freedoms have been highly influential, and OIE ac-\\ncepts them as one of the guiding principles governing animal \\nwelfare. They are also referenced in most European welfare leg-\\nislation, referred to by veterinary and animal welfare organiza-\\ntions worldwide, and form the basis for OIE Terrestrial Animal \\nHealth Code Article 7.1.1. However, they also have drawbacks. In \\nparticular, it is not easy to decide which normal or innate behav-\\niours are important for animals in captive environments. Recently, \\nthe European Welfare Quality consortium (www.welfarequality.\\nnet/everyone) has expanded and clarified the components of ani-\\nmal welfare, proposing a set of four principles and 12 criteria, as \\nshown Table 1. \\nResource-based and animal-based measures\\nOnce the principles and criteria for good welfare have been \\nagreed, ways of measuring each criterion need to be devised. \\nThese measures can be used on farms or other livestock enterpris-\\nes to assess animal welfare. Early assessments of animals on farms \\nwere made by observing whether key resources (e.g., nests or \\nclean drinkers) were present; such measures are called resource-\\nbased measures. However, the presence of a resource does not \\nmean necessarily mean that it is being used effectively. Recently, \\nthere has therefore been a move to make direct observations and \\nmeasurements of the animals themselves, using animal-based \\noutcome measures. This is important to ensuring the good wel-\\nfare of all individual animals within a flock or herd.'),\n",

The Welfare Qual-\\nity Project has suggested appropriate measures that could be \\nused to assess each of the 12 welfare criteria for poultry, and the \\nmajority of these are animal-based outcome measures. Thus, the \\nabsence of hunger can be measured by assessing emaciation on \\nan agreed scale, and thermal comfort can be measured by assess-\\ning whether birds are panting or huddling. In drawing an overall \\nconclusion about the welfare of chickens at a specific site, the \\nmeasures for each criterion can be given different weights, with \\nhigher weights given to criteria that are thought to be especially \\nimportant. \\nScientific assessment of welfare\\nIt is important that the measures used on farms to assess ani-\\nmal welfare are backed up by more fundamental scientific re-\\nsearch, to ensure that they really do measure factors associated \\nwith quality of life. The scientific assessment of poultry welfare \\nusually depends on measuring a range of physiological, behav-\\nioural or clinical indicators, and comparing these measurements \\namong chickens that are housed or treated differently in some \\nway. A broad range of indicators can be used to assess stress re-\\nsponse and immune function in an attempt to measure whether \\nthe animal is coping with its environment or not. However, inter-\\npretation of these indicators is sometimes difficult. An alternative \\nscientific approach has therefore been to examine the environ-\\nmental conditions chosen by chickens. Early studies examined the \\nenvironmental choices of chickens for food types, laying, foraging \\nand exploratory materials, heat, lighting, and social conditions. \\nThe strength and importance of these preferences has recently \\nbeen assessed by determining how hard chickens will work to \\nobtain these resources or conditions when access becomes more \\ndifficult or demands more energy (Nicol, 2010). Important new \\nscientific research is examining how welfare indicators and the \\nenvironmental choices of chickens interrelate (Nicol et al., 2009). \\nThe International Society for Applied Ethology is a scientific body \\nwith an interest in how animal behaviour can be used to assess \\nanimal welfare (www.applied-ethology.org/index.htm). Many \\nother organizations are interested in the scientific assessment of \\nwelfare; their newsletters can be accessed via the FAO website: \\nwww.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/animal-welfare/en/.\\nInteractions between welfare and \\nproductivity \\nIt is often thought that good production will itself guarantee \\ngood welfare, but the relationship between production and wel-\\nfare is more complex than this. \\nIn the following two examples, welfare and production are \\npositively associated: \\n(i) In some backyard, village environments, chickens may be able \\nto express normal behaviour, but their overall welfare may be poor \\nif they are affected by disease, parasitism or malnutrition. Address-\\ning these welfare issues will also result in increased productivity. \\n(ii) In many cases, acute or chronically stressful events will re-\\nduce productivity. For example, moving hens from pens to cages \\nproduces a marked short-term decrease in egg production. Simi-\\nlarly, chronic stress can impair immune function and lead to in-\\ncreased disease and mortality, and reduced production. \\nHowever, in the next two examples, welfare and production \\nare in conflict:\\n(i) Intense genetic selection for production traits can have ad-\\nverse consequences on other aspects of bird health. For example, \\nlaying hens selected for high egg production have increased skel-\\netal problems (see information note on “Welfare issues in com-\\nmercial egg production”), and broiler chickens selected for very \\nhigh growth rates have problems with leg health and lameness \\n(see information note on “Welfare issues in commercial broiler \\nproduction”).\\n(ii) Restricting the quantity of feed fed to broiler-breeding \\nflocks/birds is a normal management method because egg pro-\\nduction and hatchability are poor if female breeding birds are fed \\nad libitum. However, this means that the birds experience chronic \\nhunger (see Information note “Broilers”). \\nSafe-guarding animal welfare\\nWhen production gains can be achieved by improving animal \\nwelfare, as in the first two examples above, there should be no \\nneed for any other mechanism to safe-guard animal welfare; ad-\\ndressing issues of health or malnutrition will benefit both farmers \\nand chickens. This is why poultry welfare is being integrated into \\nfood safety policy, based on scientific evidence that well-treated \\nanimals are generally healthier and more productive than badly \\ntreated ones (European Commission, 2002). OIE also recognizes \\nthe links between welfare and animal health and is introducing \\nguidelines for the transport and slaughter of farmed animals. \\nHowever, when increased production conflicts with good welfare, \\nother checks and balances are required to ensure that the animals \\nare not suffering or unduly exploited. The mechanisms available \\nto ensure good welfare in these circumstances include the law, \\ncodes of practice and voluntary assurance schemes. \\nPoultry welfare and the law\\nThe extent to which poultry welfare is protected by the law varies \\ngreatly. In 2000, the European Scientific Committee on Animal \\nHealth and Animal Welfare investigated international welfare \\nstandards and found no generally recognized, specific standards \\nworldwide. Although there appears to be little legislation in the \\ndeveloping world concerning the welfare of farmed animals, \\nmany other countries have laws relating to acts of cruelty to indi-\\nvidual animals.

Most legislation refers to the Five Freedoms \\n(FAWC, 1979), but this may change if the expanded principles \\nand criteria mentioned earlier become widely accepted. Increased \\nlegislation often follows increased public awareness of animal \\nwelfare issues.\\nThere are two main approaches to introducing welfare legisla-\\ntion (European Commission, 2002). Binding codes are usually in-\\ncluded within legislation, and it is a legal requirement to conform. \\nAn example of binding legislation in the EU is the Laying Hens \\nDirective (1999). As part of an interim review of the scientific evi-\\ndence required before adoption of the legislation, the European \\nFood Safety Authority (EFSA, 2005) produced an opinion on the \\nwelfare aspects of all housing systems used for laying hens. Fol-\\nlowing this, the LayWel project, funded via the European Com-\\nmission’s Sixth Framework Programme and national funding from \\nseveral EU countries, studied the welfare implications of different \\npoultry farming systems. The scientific opinion derived from both \\nthese exercises provided the basis for banning conventional cag-\\nes, summarizing evidence that conventional cages do not allow \\nhens to fulfil behaviour priorities, and present a significant threat \\nto the birds’ skeletal health. The EU ban on conventional cages is \\nscheduled to take effect from 1 January 2012. From that date, all \\ncages must contain enrichment (furnishings to assist the birds in \\nperforming natural behaviours), such as an area for dust-bathing, \\nand perches. The EU has also introduced a Broiler Directive (2007), \\nwhich limits the stocking density at which poultry may be kept for \\nmeat production. Farmers will be able to keep broiler chickens at \\nhigher densities only when high welfare is exhibited and proved. \\nThis is likely to be assessed by looking at animal-based outcome \\nmeasures such as mortality. \\nCodes of practice \\nNon-binding codes of practice can be used alongside the law. \\nCodes of practice establish recommendations for good practice \\nas followed by competent and conscientious practitioners. Codes \\nof practice can be particularly useful if they set out clearly what \\nfarmers must do to ensure good welfare (minimum standards), \\nand what they can do further to optimize welfare.\\nSelf-imposed codes/assurance schemes\\nIn many countries, there are voluntary schemes for certifying that \\nfarm animals have been kept at specified welfare standards. Self-\\nimposed codes are voluntary, but producers conform as they are \\nlikely to offer a marketing advantage. Examples include farm as-\\nsurance schemes, which are common in Europe. They have been \\nintroduced in response to consumer demands that animal prod-\\nucts satisfy certain safety, environmental and welfare standards.\\nHousing and management of poultry\\nIn developing countries, the majority of poultry are indigenous \\nbreeds, kept in small flocks living in a backyard, village environ-\\nment. Gueye (1998) reports that approximately 80 percent of \\npoultry in Africa can be found in traditional production systems. \\nIn these systems, birds are generally free-ranging and often scav-\\nenge or are fed household scraps. In this type of poultry produc-\\ntion system there is no real distinction between birds reared for \\nmeat and those kept as egg layers. Poultry meat is typically ob-\\ntained from males killed at between 12 and 20 weeks of age, and \\nfrom egg laying birds that have ceased to be productive. \\nMany developing countries are now investing heavily in more \\nintensive commercial systems of poultry production to provide \\nmeat and eggs for growing urban and peri-urban populations. In \\nthese systems, egg laying hens and broiler meat chickens are ge-\\nnetically very different from each other and from the indigenous \\nbreeds kept in small family flocks by villagers in rural areas, and \\nare kept and managed differently. \\nIntensive broiler production systems obtain chicks from com-\\nmercial hatcheries, and then house them in flocks in floor-\\nbased systems until they reach slaughter weight, when they are \\ncaught, transported and slaughtered at a specialized abattoir. \\nIntensive egg production systems also obtain chicks from com-\\nmercial hatcheries, but these chicks are usually kept in large \\nrearing flocks until they reach sexual maturity and start to pro-\\nduce eggs. At point of lay, the pullets are transported to the \\nadult housing system, which contains egg-handling facilities. A \\ngreat range of adult housing systems exists, including conven-\\ntional cage, furnished cage, single-tier aviary, multi-tier indoor, \\nand free-range (described in www. laywel.eu). At the end of the \\ncommercial laying period, generally at around 18 to 24 months \\nof age, these birds are caught, transported and slaughtered in \\nspecialized facilities. \\nMajor welfare issues\\nPoultry welfare is affected by genetics, by the hatching, rearing \\nand adult housing environments, by the methods of transport \\nand slaughter employed, and to a great degree by the attitudes \\nand standards of care of the stockpersons.\\nWelfare issues in a village environment \\nIn the village environment, birds are mainly indigenous breeds, \\nwhich are generally better able to cope with the natural environ-\\nment than those breeds that have undergone extensive genetic \\nselection for production traits. However, disease transmission is \\nhigh in backyard poultry systems, often resulting in low produc-\\ntivity and high mortality. Newcastle disease is one of the most \\nproblematic and widespread diseases in both village and intensive \\nproduction systems. Vaccines have been developed, but not all \\nfarmers have access to them, and vaccinating free-ranging poul-\\ntry can be a challenge (FAO, 2001).\\nAnother challenge facing small-scale poultry producers in \\ndeveloping countries is the availability of appropriate nutrition. \\nMany smallholder farmers and their families have limited food, \\nand are thus unable to provide feed for their small scavenging \\nchicken flocks. Poultry frequently also lack access to a source of \\nclean and cool water. This is a welfare concern for the poultry \\nand for the people rearing them, as productivity will be low. In \\nhot climates, birds may have difficulty staying cool if natural or \\nartificial shelter is not provided, as all chickens are derived from \\njungle-living birds and they actively seek shade. \\nMost of these welfare issues can be addressed by improved \\nveterinary care and nutrition and the provision of simple facilities \\nsuch as clean drinking-water and shade. \\nWelfare issues of broilers in commercial production \\nThe major welfare issues for commercially reared broilers are leg'),\n",

Consumers are interested in the origin of their \\npoultry products, and surveys such as Euro-barometer show that \\nmost people believe that the broiler and laying hen industries \\nneed to improve the current level of bird welfare: \\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/survey/sp_barometer_\\nfa_en.pdf. \\nConsumers’ perception of animal welfare can affect the type \\nof products purchased; 43 percent of consumers say that they \\nconsider the welfare and protection of meat animals before they \\nmake a purchase. \\nAccess to markets\\nAt present, the World Trade Organization (WTO) operates a free-\\ntrade policy and will not allow countries to restrict trade because \\nof differing standards of animal welfare. This is becoming a con-\\ncern within the EU, however, where there are guidelines relat-\\ning to animal welfare to which farmers must conform. The EU is \\npushing for welfare to be included in the WTO multi-lateral trade \\nnegotiations. If this happens, imported products will have to meet \\nbasic EU standards to enter this market. \\nEmployment\\nImprovements in animal welfare can create work in countries \\nwhere employment is difficult to find. It is particularly important \\nthat intensification is coupled with increased labour, as one of the \\nbest ways of raising animal welfare standards is to improve in-\\nspection and handling practices. Intensification without increased \\nlabour may result in welfare problems being overlooked. In many \\ndeveloping countries, poultry are raised by women and children. \\nLearning how to raise poultry to optimal welfare standards can \\nhelp women to improve their productivity, and may help alleviate \\npoverty. Organizations such as the International Network for Fam-\\nily Poultry Development and the Network for Small-holder Poultry \\nDevelopment are helping village women to make their poultry \\nenterprises more productive, efficient and profitable. This has a \\npositive impact on the empowerment of women and provides \\nthem with social contact both within and outside the village. \\nThe model farm project set up by the World Society for the \\nProtection of Animals and the Food Animal Initiative also aims to \\nhelp farmers in developing countries to rear their animals in ways \\nthat will provide them with optimal economic outputs. A number \\nof farms have been set up in China, where high-welfare animals \\nare reared to organic standards and receive a premium when sold. \\nThe farms provide training for producers and exemplify a viable \\nalternative to intensive farming.\\nReferences\\nBroom, D.M. 1986 Indicators of poor welfare.

First some issues affecting \\nchicks and growing pullets are mentioned, before discussing the \\nmost significant issues facing adult laying hens. \\nChicks and pullets\\nDisposal of male chicks\\nWhen chicks are hatched for egg production, only females are \\nneeded. Male layer strain chicks have no commercial value, which \\nmeans that 50 percent of the chicks hatched have to be killed. \\nTheir disposal raises practical and ethical issues. Methods of dis-\\nposal vary from region to region and country to country. In all \\ncases, the aim should be to ensure that every male chick is killed \\nhumanely and instantaneously. \\nChick handling\\nWhether chicks are to be reared for meat or egg production, it \\nis important that they are handled with care in the hatchery. Af-\\nter being taken from the hatching trays by hand, chicks may ei-\\nther be sexed and sorted manually, or placed on a conveyor from \\nwhich the males (often with different sex linked feathering rate or \\nfeather colour) are removed for slaughter. The female chicks are \\nthen placed in disposable chick boxes with perforated ventilation \\nholes, for transport to the rearing houses.\\nVariation in chick or pullet sizes\\nThe aim of the hatcheries and farms that supply pullets should be \\nto produce birds of even body-weight and size. Variation in size \\ncan result in later problems of aggression, poor performance and \\ninjurious pecking. \\nLaying hens\\nOsteoporosis\\nOsteoporosis in laying hens is a major welfare concern. It is the \\nprogressive loss of structural bone throughout the skeleton, which \\nresults in weakened bones. Weakened bones can lead to a high \\nnumber of birds suffering keel, leg and wing fractures, which are \\nlikely to be painful. Osteoporosis can also cause birds to become \\nparalysed, which can lead to death. Loss of structural bone in \\nhens begins around sexual maturity and continues throughout \\nthe laying period. The process is accelerated in caged systems, \\nwhich prevent birds from exercising. Fleming et al. (2006) found \\nsignificant improvements in bone strength when birds were \\nhoused in aviaries, rather than battery cages. Nutrition also ap-\\npears to affect bone strength, and the effects of osteoporosis can \\nbe minimized by providing sufficient calcium, phosphorus and \\nvitamin D in the diet. Another contributor to the severity of os-\\nteoporosis is genotype. Some genetic strains appear to be more \\nsusceptible to osteoporosis than others. It has been suggested \\nthat it is possible to select genetically against osteoporosis while \\nstill maintaining a high egg yield, but this has not been attempted \\non a commercial scale. \\nKeel fractures\\nOne consequence of osteoporosis is that it greatly increases the \\nsusceptibility of bones to damage and fracture. In laying hens, the \\nbone most likely to sustain a fracture is the keel bone, which can \\nbe damaged in two main ways: i) by misjudged landings when \\nbirds are perching or nesting in a furnished environment; or ii) \\nwhen birds are handled during depopulation at the end of lay. \\nThe incidence of keel fractures caused by furnishings is higher in \\nnon-cage systems than in cage systems. In free-range and single-\\ntier aviary systems (barns), the mean prevalence of bone break-\\nages is 65 percent, 90 percent of which are keel bone breaks \\n(Wilkins et al., 2004). These findings are of particular importance \\nin the EU, where conventional cages are being banned in 2012. \\nHowever, the incidence of new breaks – those caused during de-\\npopulation – is higher in conventional cage systems than in other \\nsystems. This may be attributed to weaker bones in caged birds, \\ndue to lack of exercise. Access to the birds within the cage (i.e., \\nthe size of the aperture) and the manner in which the birds are \\nwithdrawn from the cage during depopulation are critical factors \\nin determining bone breakages.\\nBehavioural restriction\\nIn 1999, the EU introduced the Laying Hens Directive, stating that \\nall hens must be housed in an enriched environment from 2012 \\nonwards. This has involved the introduction of furnished cages, \\nwhich will replace conventional caged systems. Furnished cages \\nwill provide birds with a nest, perches and pecking/scratching \\nmats. A recent study comparing the physical and physiological \\ncondition of birds in four different housing systems for layers in \\nthe United Kingdom concluded that these aspects of bird welfare \\nare better in furnished cages than in any other system (Sherwin, \\nRichards and Nicol, 2010)\\nThe importance of providing nests, perches and pecking areas \\nstems from the natural behaviour of chickens. In the wild, poultry \\nhave the ability to build nests, scratch and peck, dust-bath and \\nperch. These are all behaviours that have not been lost through \\ngenetic modification of poultry breeds and they are still important \\nfor good welfare of modern-day laying hen (Weeks and Nicol, \\n2006). In conventional cages, it is virtually impossible for hens \\nto perform these behaviours. Hens also need at least 600 cm2'),\n",

Furnished cages do not allow birds total behavioural \\nfreedom, but they do allow birds to perform their most important \\nbehaviours to a degree not possible in conventional cages. \\nNon-cage systems permit even greater freedom of behaviour \\nfor the majority of birds in a flock. In large flocks of hens, how-\\never, some birds’ access to facilities such as nests and perches is \\nrestricted by other birds, and aggression can be common. A small \\nproportion of birds in non-cage systems can be excessively per-\\nsecuted by their flock-mates. These so-called “pariah” birds have \\nextremely poor welfare. \\nInjurious pecking \\nInjurious pecking in laying hens is a major welfare concern that \\ncan spread through flocks, resulting in pain and high mortality. In-\\njurious pecking can occur in all types of layer hen housing. In cage \\nsystems persecuted birds are unable to escape, but the problem \\ntends to be confined to particular cages. In non-cage systems, \\nonce injurious pecking starts it can spread rapidly throughout the \\nwhole flock. Injurious pecking comprises feather pecking, vent \\npecking and cannibalism. \\nFeather pecking\\nGentle feather pecking occurs when one hen pecks at the feathers \\nof another, without pulling or removing the feathers. Severe feath-\\ner pecking occurs when feathers are pulled violently or removed. \\nThe relationship between these two types of feather pecking is not \\nclear, and they appear to have distinct risk factors. There may be \\na number of reasons for the onset of feather pecking, including \\ndeprivation of natural behaviours such as ground pecking (Roden-\\nburg and Koene, 2004). The inability to perform behaviours can \\nlead to long-term frustration, which may result in arousal, aggres-\\nsion or fear. Any of these emotional states may increase the likeli-\\nhood that a hen will start feather pecking. There are clear genetic \\ninfluences on feather pecking (Rodenburg et al., 2008), and epi-\\ndemiological studies have identified a range of important environ-\\nmental risk factors. Bald patches on hens, where feathers have \\nbeen removed, encourage further pecking of exposed body tissue. \\nThis has an economic impact on production, as birds lose energy \\nand heat and therefore consume more food. Feather pecking is \\nlikely to be very painful for the affected hens, and may lead to can-\\nnibalism. The risks of feather pecking can be reduced by feeding \\nmash rather than pelleted diets; providing additional foraging and \\nfibre sources, such as chopped straw and vegetables; and ensuring \\ngood litter condition, to encourage birds to peck the litter rather \\nthan each other. Reducing light intensity is a short-term measure \\nthat does not address the cause of the problem.\\nCannibalism \\nCannibalism occurs when the flesh or blood of another individ-\\nual of the same species is consumed. It is a common problem in \\npoultry, particularly laying hens (Newberry, 2004). Cannibalistic \\nbehaviour may be learned by hens, and the problem can spread \\nrapidly throughout a flock. Cannibalism can arise as a result of \\nsevere feather or vent pecking, which often occurs due to frustra-\\ntion. Producers have attempted to reduce the incidence of feath-\\ner pecking and cannibalism by beak trimming, which involves \\nremoval of up to two-thirds of the upper beak. This process is \\nlikely to cause pain, and does not combat the root of the prob-\\nlem. Some producers raise birds at low light intensities so they do \\nnot have the visibility to perform cannibalism. This has not been \\neffective however, as the increased light levels needed to inspect \\nbirds are associated with cannibalism. Beak trimming has been \\nbanned in a number of countries, so an alternative is needed. \\nProviding birds with enrichment, such as litter to peck at, may \\nreduce frustration. It is also important to provide pullets with litter \\nin their rearing environment. Cannibalism is also positively corre-\\nlated with mineral, protein and energy deficiencies, so providing \\nall nutritional requirements may reduce cannibalism. Selection of \\ngenetic strains that are not predisposed to cannibalism should \\nalso be encouraged. \\nVent pecking\\nAs with feather pecking, vent pecking can lead to cannibalism. \\nVent pecking is directed at the tissue around the cloaca (see pho-\\nto). \\nThis may be investigative behaviour to begin with, but once \\nestablished can lead to birds pecking at internal organs or tissue. \\nThe result is often death. It is therefore advantageous to prevent \\nbirds from viewing the cloacal areas of other birds, by ensuring \\nthat nesting areas are not brightly lit and that there are sensible \\nperch arrangements. It is also important not to bring the flock \\ninto lay too early – vent pecking can be triggered when small \\nbirds are encouraged to lay large eggs too early. \\nEmaciation\\nThe metabolic demands of high egg production are great, and by \\nthe end of lay many hens show signs of emaciation, poor body \\ncondition and chronic stress. This can be minimized by ensuring \\nthat a good diet with adequate levels of nutrition is supplied to-\\nwards the end of the laying period. \\nAvoiding welfare problems in hens\\nSeveral sources provide advice on avoiding welfare problems in \\nlayers. These include national government codes of practice, such'),\n",

Manufacturers of \\nfurnished cage systems are listed in the LayWel project de-\\nscription of laying systems: www.laywel.eu/web/pdf/deliver-\\nable%2023.pdf.\\n• Produce plans for preventing or coping with emergencies such \\nas equipment breakdown or fire.\\n• Inspect flocks at least twice a day and check individual birds, \\neven in cage systems where it can be difficult to observe indi-\\nvidual birds at the back of a cage. At monthly intervals, catch \\nsamples of birds to look more closely for problems such as mite \\ninfestations or vent pecking. \\n• Keep good records of mortality and the causes of mortality. \\nRecord spontaneous mortality separately from culling figures. \\n• Seek veterinary advice if birds show signs of sickness. There \\nare many links between poor welfare and poor health/disease. \\nImproving one can often improve the other. \\n• If possible, obtain birds from rearing units close to the laying \\nfarm, as this will minimize stress during transfer. The new laying \\nflock will settle more easily and early egg production is likely to \\nbe improved. \\n• Do not bring the flock into lay too early. Onset of lay at 17 or \\n18 weeks is associated with a greater risk of vent pecking than \\nonset of lay at 19 weeks. \\n• Do not place perches at heights that permit one bird to peck \\nanother bird’s vent. \\n• The use of mash rather than pelleted feed allows the hens to \\nspend a longer time feeding, and reduces the risk of injurious \\npecking. \\n• The provision of good, dry litter to a depth of at least 10 cm is \\nvital for the good management of hens in non-cage systems. \\n• For birds in non-cage systems, provide a raised slatted or wire \\nmesh area separate from the litter area. Do not provide high \\nperches, which are associated with “crash-landings” and sub-\\nsequent bone fractures. \\n• In non-cage flocks, the risk of injurious pecking can be reduced \\nby ensuring that the litter area is kept dry and friable. Add fresh \\nlitter regularly and, if possible, provide hens with additional \\npecking materials, such as straw or other dry vegetation. \\n• If the birds have access to an outdoor range area, encourage \\nthem to go outside as much as possible, by providing areas of \\nshelter (from sun or rain) on the range. This reduces the risk of \\ninjurious pecking in the flock. \\n• Birds should have at least eight hours of light and at least six \\nhours of dark in every 24-hour period, and light levels should \\nnot be less than 10 lux. In non-cage systems, consider provid-\\ning brighter light over the litter areas, to encourage birds to for-\\nage and dust-bath, and lower light levels near the nest boxes \\nand perches, to reduce the risk of vent pecking. \\nReferences\\nEFSA. 2005.

General issues of health and \\ndisease are considered elsewhere (see review on Poultry Health \\nand Disease Control in Developing Countries).\\nLeg health\\nThe incidence of leg disorders is a major issue in broiler produc-\\ntion and often leads to lameness. The most recent large-scale \\nstudy in the United Kingdom found that 27.6 percent of the birds \\nassessed close to slaughter age showed poor locomotion, and 3.3 \\npercent were almost unable to walk (Knowles et al., 2008). These \\nfigures arose even though the participating farms had good cull-\\ning procedures, with severely lame birds identified and killed \\nhumanely to avoid further suffering. A similarly high prevalence \\nof lameness has been found in other studies around the world \\nover the past 15 years. Assuming the worldwide prevalence of \\nleg disorders is similar to that in the United Kingdom this equates \\nto 12.5 billion broilers experiencing leg problems worldwide per \\nyear. Although breeding companies are directing far more atten-\\ntion and resources to finding ways of selecting against leg disor-\\nders, negative correlations with meat yield can sometimes hinder \\nprogress.\\nThere are several causes of lameness in broiler chickens, broad-\\nly divided into infectious and developmental causes, although \\nthe two are interrelated. One of the main factors contributing to \\nboth types of leg problems is genotype. Through intensification \\nof production and genetic selection over the last 50 years, broiler \\ngrowth rates have increased from 25 g per day to 100 g per day \\n– a 300 percent increase. Owing to the rapid growth of broiler \\nchickens, it is possible for them to reach slaughter weight at less \\nthan 40 days of age. The problem is that this rapid growth places \\nstress on the skeleton, resulting in skeletal abnormalities. Rapid \\ngrowth can result in valgus varus deformation, ruptured tendons, \\nseparation of the proximal epiphysis, bending and rotation of \\nthe tibia, osteochondrosis, degenerative bone disease and micro-\\nfractures. It has also been demonstrated experimentally that rapid \\ngrowth increases the risk of a range of infectious leg conditions \\nincluding arthritis and tenosynovitis. Generally, the risk of lame-\\nness increases rapidly with bird age, up to the point of slaughter. \\nThe innervation of chicken legs is similar to that in humans, so leg \\ndisorders may be painful to poultry (European Commission, 2000) \\nand some causes of lameness may be associated with more pain \\nthan others. When birds are given analgesic (pain-killing) drugs, \\ntheir walking ability generally improves. In addition, one study \\nshowed that lame birds preferentially select food containing an \\nanalgesic drug, a feeding pattern not observed in non-lame birds, \\nwhich suggests that birds might actively seek to control their own \\npain levels. \\nEnvironmental and management factors that increase the risk \\nof chickens developing lameness include diet, lighting regime and \\nantibiotic use (Knowles et al., 2008). It is also generally accepted \\nthat stocking density has an effect on lameness, although there is \\nconflicting evidence. Dawkins, Donnelly and Jones (2004) report \\nthat other environmental and management factors such as air \\nand litter quality within the house may have more of an effect \\non bird welfare than stocking density. Nonetheless, high stock-\\ning density does seem to exacerbate other welfare problems, and \\nthe EU Broiler Directive (2007) sets limits on stocking density for \\nfarms where leg health problems are apparent. \\nLameness is not the only leg problem affecting broiler chickens. \\nContact dermatitis (pododermatitis) appears to be increasing in \\nprevalence in some countries. Signs of contact dermatitis include \\nthe appearance of lesions, ulcers or scabs on the footpads (see \\nphoto), hocks or breast. In severe cases, extensive areas of skin \\nmay turn black. This results from these parts of the birds’ bod-\\nies being in prolonged contact with irritant substances derived \\nfrom faeces, such as ammonia. Lesions can act as a gateway for \\nbacteria, which may spread through the bloodstream and cause \\njoint inflammation.  \\nMetabolic disorders\\nThere are a number of problems associated with poultry metabo-\\nlism, and they often have a genetic cause. The major issues result \\nfrom a very high metabolic rate, efficient feed conversion and \\nrapid growth. Rapid growth places pressure on poultry’s internal \\norgans. This can lead to cardiovascular diseases, the most preva-\\nlent of which are ascites and sudden death syndrome. Ascites is \\nthe accumulation of fluid in the lungs and abdomen caused by'),\n",

Such \\nsymptoms are usually associated with wet and dirty litter. If le-\\nsions are apparent, take steps to improve litter condition and \\nventilation. \\n• Keep basic records detailing the number of birds in the house, \\nmaximum and minimum temperatures, etc.\\n• Keep good records of mortality and the causes of mortality. \\nRecord spontaneous mortality separately from culling figures. \\n• Birds that cannot move sufficiently well to have easy access to \\nfeed and water should be culled, as they are unlikely to recover \\nand culling will prevent them from experiencing further suf-\\nfering. \\n• Manage the litter, keeping it as dry and friable as possible. Do \\nnot allow ammonia levels to rise too high. Consider topping up \\nthe litter frequently, to allow birds to rest and dust-bath and to \\nminimize the risk of skin lesions and ulcers. \\n• Avoid high stocking densities, as these are associated with de-\\npressed health and welfare.\\n• Providing perches at a height of 10 to 30 cm above the floor \\ncan improve leg health. Allow a minimum of 2 m of perch \\nlength per 1 000 birds. \\n• Average growth rates of more than 45 g per day from hatch to \\nslaughter may be associated with welfare problems. \\n• Ensure that birds have a period of darkness in each 24-hour \\nperiod, to allow them to rest. \\n• Make sure that wild birds, cats, dogs or rodents cannot enter \\nthe chicken house. \\n• Check for the appearance of panting, which may indicate that \\nthe birds are too hot. Good ventilation is essential.

Catching teams are required to grasp large numbers \\nof birds quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, this often involves \\nhandling them incorrectly. The preferable method for handling \\nchickens is to catch both legs simultaneously, to avoid hip disloca-\\ntions and broken bones. However, owing to the speed at which \\nthe catching team works, it is usual for only one leg to be caught, \\nwhich often results in painful leg dislocations. Birds are usually \\ninverted when caught, so that many may be held in each hand \\nsimultaneously. This does not provide optimal bird welfare, as \\nbirds prefer to be held upright. These processes are likely to cause \\npain (Weeks, 2007) to the birds, so it is important that they are \\nhandled as carefully as possible to minimize the risk of damage. \\nTechniques are being developed for avoiding excessive han-\\ndling of birds during depopulation. Automated “broiler harvest-\\ners” are large machines that depopulate broiler houses rapidly, \\nby picking up chickens using revolving rubber fingers. Trials have \\ndemonstrated that they may halve the risk of catching damage \\nto the legs (Weeks, 2007), but they can only be used in large \\nclear-span houses. Similar good results can be achieved if birds \\nare caught using gentle and correct handling techniques. \\nCage systems for laying hens present special problems during \\ndepopulation, and injury and damage levels can be high, as birds \\nhave to be removed from the cage fronts. In the EU, attempts \\nhave been made to improve cage design so that birds can be \\nremoved more easily through the whole cage front, rather than \\nthrough narrow gaps; this has resulted in a reduced incidence of \\nbroken bones sustained at the end of lay.\\nTransport \\nIn developing countries, there are three main methods for slaugh-\\ntering birds. The system in which they are reared determines \\nwhether and how they will be transported. Backyard village poul-\\ntry are often slaughtered by their keepers, within the home envi-\\nronment, which does not require transportation. Larger producers \\nhowever transport birds to either a “wet” market or a commer-\\ncial abattoir. The range of transportation to each varies among \\ncountries and regions. In general, birds that are slaughtered in \\nabattoirs are transported from the farm in large loose-crates or on \\nmodulated lorries, similar to those used in the EU. The stocking \\ndensity is usually very high, as few legal guidelines exist. This pos-\\nes a problem, particularly in very hot countries, where many birds \\nmay die of heat stress. A major welfare issue with this method of \\ntransport is the movement of birds from a controlled (relatively \\nstable) environment to a lorry, which may provide birds with little \\nprotection from extreme climates.\\nIn many developing countries, there is demand for fresh meat, \\nand animals are often killed at markets in the presence of the \\nconsumer. Worldwide, billions of people buy their poultry at \\n“wet” markets, many of which are unlicensed. Birds are often \\ntransported under stressful conditions. Small producers may uti-\\nlize what little transport they have by tying poultry to the back of \\ntheir bicycles or motorcycles, often in an inverted position, thus \\ncausing a high degree of stress.\\nSlaughter\\nIn large commercial abattoirs, chickens are generally stunned be-\\nfore being slaughtered. A stunning process causes immediate loss \\nof consciousness, which lasts until death. Stunning in poultry is \\nusually performed by passing an electric current across the brain, \\ndisrupting normal electrical activity and causing a loss of con-\\nsciousness (HSA, no date). This enables them to be killed without \\nfeeling the pain associated with the slaughter process. \\nIn large abattoirs, poultry arrive on lorries and are often kept in \\na lairage (holding area) before being killed. In extreme climates, \\nthis can be very stressful as birds are densely stocked and un-\\nable to cool themselves. Many birds may die before reaching the \\nslaughter line, often through heat stress. Not only is this bad for \\nHighly stressfull transport of chickens'),\n",

This is like-\\nly to cause pain, particularly for large birds, as the shackles are \\none-size and do not accommodate variations in bird leg size and \\nshape. The shackles carry birds through an electrically charged \\nwater-bath stunner. It is essential that the stunner is monitored to \\nensure that it delivers enough electricity through the brain of each \\nbird. Birds should be observed for the following signs of effective \\nstunning: neck arched and eyes open; no rhythmic breathing; rig-\\nidly extended legs; constant rapid body tremors; and wings held \\nclose to the body (HSA, no date). \\nFollowing stunning, birds may regain consciousness if the brain \\nhas not been properly disabled. This makes it essential that birds \\nare bled (by cutting the blood vessels in the neck) within 15 sec-\\nonds after stunning. In the United Kingdom, it is a legislative re-\\nquirement that at least one carotid artery is severed during neck-\\ncutting. However, it is recommended that both carotid arteries and \\nboth jugular veins are severed, as death then occurs more rapidly. \\nSlaughter of village poultry\\nIn a village environment, poultry that are not transported to be \\nsold at wet markets are likely to be slaughtered on demand within \\nthe village. It is likely that only a few birds will be slaughtered at \\na time, giving the slaughterer plenty of time to ensure that each \\nbird is killed humanely. In wet markets, however, less time may be \\ntaken over slaughtering birds, and it is likely that a number are still \\nconscious while being killed. Unlike in commercial abattoirs, stun-\\nning is rare at wet markets, although it is a legal requirement in a \\nnumber of countries. An alternative to the water-bath stunner is \\na hand-held, low voltage stunner with electrodes that are placed \\neither side of the bird’s brain, passing an electric current through \\nit (HSA, no date); however, this has not yet been widely adopted. \\nThe methods of slaughtering poultry that are likely to be used \\nin villages are neck dislocation, decapitation or delivering a con-\\ncussive blow to the head (leading to loss of brain function). Al-\\nthough none of these methods provide pre-slaughter stunning, \\nthey are regularly used for emergency on-farm killing. Each of \\nthe three methods has welfare problems associated with it. If per-\\nformed correctly, a concussive blow to a chicken’s head may be \\nthe most effective way of killing it. To be effective, however, the \\nblow must be very heavy and accurately directed to the bony part \\nof the head, behind the comb. If delivered to any other part of \\nthe head, soft tissue may absorb some of the force of the blow, \\nwhich may not result in concussion. For a concussive blow to be \\na reliable method of slaughter, it must be performed accurately \\nand consistently.\\nNeck dislocation and decapitation must also be performed \\ncorrectly to be effective methods of slaughter. Of the two, de-\\ncapitation may be the more reliable, as it involves severing all the \\narteries supplying blood to the brain (the largest of which are the \\ncarotid arteries in the neck) immediately. This gives a very rapid \\nloss of blood pressure, and death follows shortly after (HSA, no \\ndate). Neck dislocation involves stretching the neck to dislocate \\nthe spinal cord and cause damage to the surrounding blood ves-\\nsels (HSA, no date). The procedure can be difficult to perform \\ncorrectly and consistently, and does not always concuss the brain, \\ncausing insensibility. It is therefore not recommended as a rou-\\ntine method of slaughter (HSA, no date). As with the commercial \\nslaughter of poultry, bleeding should be carried out immediately \\nafter either neck dislocation or producing concussion, to ensure \\nthat the birds are killed. \\nReferences\\nHSA. no date.

MC aqueous solutions at 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06% were challenged with Salmonella\\nTyphimurium and Campylobacter jejuni at 6 log CFU/mL, resulting in complete inactivation of both bacteria in 30 min with\\n0.06% MC. Follow-up experiments were performed using test materials treated with 0.1 and 1% MC and challenged with\\nSalmonella Typhimurium and C. jejuni at 6 log CFU per coupon. Stability of MC on the various surfaces of testing materials was\\nassessed, and the chlorine content of the materials was measured using iodometric thiosulfate titration over a 4-week period.\\nAntimicrobial activities were evaluated by a sandwich test on each sampling day during 4 weeks of storage. On the samples\\ntreated with 1% MC, bacteria at 6 log CFU per coupon were completely inactivated within 2 h of contact time. The antimicrobial\\nactivity extended to 4 weeks, and the active chlorine atoms in the treated materials decreased from the initial 1016 to 1015 atoms\\nper cm2. Overall, MC had high stability and long-lasting antimicrobial activity, which suggests that MC has high potential for use\\nas a novel antimicrobial agent to lower the microbial load on broiler house materials.\\nKey words: Antimicrobial agent; Chicken house; 1-Chloro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-imidazoidinone; N-Halamine\\nWith recent reported food product recalls, food safety\\nhas drawn increased public attention. In the United States,\\nfoodborne pathogens cause an estimated $77.7 billion in\\neconomic losses per year (21). According to the Centers for\\nDisease Control and Prevention (1), foodborne diseases\\nwere responsible for 15,202 illnesses and 15 deaths in 2015.\\nWith the ever-growing demand for poultry products in the\\nUnited States, incidents of foodborne pathogen contamina-\\ntion traced back to poultry products have a signiﬁcant\\nimpact on consumer health (4). Therefore, protecting the\\nsafety of poultry products is critical to reducing outbreaks of\\nfoodborne diseases.\\nIn the poultry industry, broiler houses are an important\\nsource of microbial contamination. Feed, litter, water\\nsupplies, and other facility components are frequently\\ncontaminated with pathogens such as Salmonella, Campylo-\\nbacter jejuni, and Staphylococcus aureus (3, 15, 22, 27).\\nPathogen shedding in these areas could lead to dissemina-\\ntion throughout the house by poultry consumption of\\ncontaminated feed or water, by crawling insects, or by\\nspatial contact under conditions of insufﬁcient hygiene.\\nBroiler houses also are the starting point for the farm-to-fork\\nfood chain, and improper management could have a\\nsubstantially negative effect on the safety of the ﬁnal\\nproducts (4, 7). The newly released Food Safety Modern-\\nization Act emphasizes the role of production practices in\\nimproving food safety (25). With improved safeguards and\\nsurveillance in broiler houses, initial pathogen loads should\\nbe reduced, resulting in safer poultry products.\\nAntibiotics administered through feed or water are\\ncommonly used in broiler production to control microbial\\ncontaminations. However, current consumer trends have\\nresulted in pressure to withdraw antibiotics from broiler\\nproduction. Surfaces of equipment and facilities are the\\nmajor areas of cross-contamination. Therefore, to maintain\\noptimal hygiene conditions in broiler houses, nonantibiotic\\nantimicrobial agents will be in high demand and widely\\napplied in the ﬁeld. Unfortunately, the current nonantibiotic\\nantimicrobials used in the poultry industry have some\\npotential harmful characteristics that must be taken into\\naccount. Peracetic acid, for example, is a strong oxidizing\\nagent and has a pungent acid odor (10), peroxygen and\\nphenolic compounds are corrosive and have a short shelf life\\n(26), formaldehyde is potentially harmful to human health\\n(5), and aluminum sulfate poses a corrosive risk (28).\\nAnother consideration is that most antimicrobials are able to\\ndisinfect surfaces effectively at the beginning but do not\\nhave long residual effects when the surface becomes\\nrecontaminated. Therefore, ﬁnding a suitable nonantibiotic\\nantimicrobial agent that is long lasting, noncorrosive, and\\nnonoxidizing with no health issues is an important avenue to\\nsolving these problems.\\n* Author for correspondence.

Most N-halamines are outstanding antimicrobial agents\\nbecause of their superior activity against a broad spectrum of\\nmicroorganisms, low or nontoxicity, high stability, recharge-\\nability, and low cost (9, 11, 13). The antimicrobial activities\\nof various N-halamine–treated materials have been well\\nstudied, and N-halamine–treated paints and water disinfec-\\ntion beads were able to inactivate pathogens (from an initial\\ninoculation level of 6 log CFU) completely in 10 min (12)\\nand 1.1 s (2), respectively.\\nMC (1-chloro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-imidazolidinone) is\\na monochlorinated N-halamine. The oxidized status of MC’s\\nchlorine atom results in its powerful antimicrobial activity.\\nMC’s unique chemical structure combined with the properties\\nshared by all N-halamines give MC a longer shelf life and a\\nmore stable chlorine atom than another popular cleaning\\nsolution, sodium hypochlorite (5). Demir et al. (6) found that\\nan MC-coated polypropylene nonwoven fabric effectively\\nand completely inactivated S. aureus (a 6-log reduction) and\\nresulted in a 4-log reduction of Escherichia coli O157:H7\\nwithin 5 min of exposure. In the same study, MC-coated\\nfabrics stored in a dark environment retained their initial\\nactive chlorine concentration for up to 6 months (6).\\nThe objectives of the present work were to evaluate the\\nantimicrobial activity and the antimicrobial longevity of MC\\nand MC-coated surface materials. To achieve these objec-\\ntives, we investigated the bactericidal activity of the MC\\ncompound against two major foodborne pathogens found in\\npoultry production: Salmonella Typhimurium and C. jejuni.\\nWe also assessed the active chlorine atoms on MC-coated\\nsurface materials and their antimicrobial activities over a 4-\\nweek storage period.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nInoculum preparation. For Salmonella Typhimurium, one\\nloopful of frozen nalidixic acid (NA)–resistant strain culture\\n(Poultry Research Unit, Auburn University, Auburn, AL) was\\nadded into 10 mL of Trypticase soy broth (TSB; BD, Sparks, MD)\\nwith 100 ppm of NA. The culture was incubated at 378C for 24 h,\\nand then one loopful of the culture was transferred to another 10\\nmL of TSB. The Salmonella Typhimurium was subcultured three\\ntimes to ensure the stability of the bacterial culture. The culture was\\nthen streaked on a Trypticase soy agar (TSA; BD) plate with 100\\nppm of NA, and the plate was incubated at 378C. After 24 h of\\nincubation, an isolated colony was added into 10 mL of TSB with\\n100 ppm of NA and incubated for 12 h under the same conditions.\\nBacteria were washed with Butterﬁeld’s phosphate buffer (BPB;\\npH 7.0) three times through centrifugation and then resuspended in\\nBPB. The bacterial population was estimated by the absorbance at\\nan optical density of 640 nm (OD640) to obtain a stock Salmonella\\nTyphimurium culture of 108 CFU/mL, which was adjusted to 4 3\\n107 CFU/mL for the inoculum.\\nOne loopful of C. jejuni from frozen culture (Poultry Research\\nUnit, Auburn University) was added into 10 mL of Brucella broth\\n(Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) with ferrous sulfate, sodium\\nbiosulﬁte, and sodium pyruvate (Hardy). Culture was put in a 1-qt\\n(0.95-L) Ziploc bag ﬁlled with a microaerophilic gaseous mixture of\\n5% O2, 10% CO2, and 85% N2, and incubated at 428C for 48 h. C.\\njejuni was subcultured three times under the same conditions to\\nensure the stability of the bacterial culture. The culture was then\\nstreaked on Campy-Cefex agar (Acumedia, Lansing, MI) with horse\\nblood and incubated at 428C under the same microaerophilic\\nconditions described previously. After 24 h of incubation, a colony\\nwas transferred to 10 mL of Brucella-FBP (FeSO4, sodium pyruvate,\\nsodium metabisulﬁte) broth and incubated for 24 h. The bacterial\\nsuspension was then centrifuged and resuspended in buffered\\npeptone water (BPW). A stock C. jejuni culture of 108 CFU/mL was\\nobtained by adjusting the absorbance of the suspension at OD640,\\nand an inoculum of 4 3 107 CFU/mL was prepared.\\nAntimicrobial activity test. The MC powder (Cangzhou\\nJincang Fine Chemical Co., Cangzhou City, People’s Republic of\\nChina; Fig. 1) was dissolved into sterile distilled water to produce\\n0, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.06% (w/v) working solutions for antimicrobial\\ntesting. Salmonella Typhimurium (100 lL, 4 3 107 CFU/mL) was\\nadded to 4 mL of the MC working solution. Sterile water was used\\nas a positive control. All samples were processed in duplicate.\\nAfter 5, 10. 30, and 60 min of contact time, the same amount (200\\nlL) of solution from each sample was transferred to 20 lL of 0.05\\nN sodium thiosulfate to quench the active chlorine residue from\\nfurther disinfection. The bacterial level was then determined\\naccording to the following procedures and at the same time\\nenriched for Salmonella based on the Food Safety and Inspection\\nService Microbiological Laboratory Guidebook (FSIS MLG)\\nmethod (24). A 10-fold serial dilution series was made for each\\nsample, and each dilution was spread plated on TSA with 100 ppm\\nof NA in triplicate. These plates were incubated at 378C for 24 h,\\nand colonies were enumerated and recorded. The inoculum was\\nconﬁrmed by a spread plate method.\\nC. jejuni suspension (100 lL, 4 3 107 CFU/mL) was added to\\n4 mL of the MC working solution. All samples were processed in\\nduplicate. After 5, 10, 30, and 60 min of contact time, 200 lL of\\nthe solution from each sample was transferred into a tube with 20\\nlL of 0.05 N sodium thiosulfate. The bacterial level was\\ndetermined according to the following procedures and enriched\\nfor C. jejuni based on the FSIS MLG method (23). All samples\\nwere decimally diluted with BPW three times, and each dilution\\nwas spread plated on Campy-Cefex agar in triplicate. These plates\\nwere incubated under the same microaerophilic conditions at 428C\\nfor 48 h, and colonies were enumerated and recorded for\\nantimicrobial activity analysis. The inoculum was veriﬁed by the\\nspread plate method. Each test was repeated twice.\\nFIGURE 1. Structure of MC (1-chloro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-\\nimidazolidinone).\\n196\\nREN ET AL.\\nJ.

These materials were cut into\\ncoupons (2.54 by 2.54 cm) and then autoclaved and completely\\ndried before use. A 95% ethanol solution was selected as the MC\\ncarrier because ethanol efﬁciently dissolves the compound and\\nevaporates quickly. Coupons of each material were spread with\\napproximately 0.25 mL of a 0.1% MC ethanol solution or a 1%\\nMC ethanol solution; control samples were treated with 95%\\nethanol alone, without MC. The coupons were coated on one side\\nonly, and treated coupons were placed on prelabeled trays, air\\ndried, and stored in a dark, enclosed cabinet at room temperature.\\nThe antimicrobial activity of these coupons was tested on days 0, 3,\\n6, 14, 21, and 28 to evaluate the antimicrobial stability of MC on\\nthese materials. In this study, chlorine-based disinfectants such as\\nbleach were not used as the positive control because they would\\nevaporate too quickly.\\nA sandwich test (29) (Fig. 2) was used to analyze the\\nantimicrobial activity of MC-treated materials. Two coupons from\\neach group coated with 0, 0.1, and 1% MC were removed from the\\ncabinet and placed into a sterile petri dish with the MC-coated side\\nup.

A\\n25-lL aliquot of inoculum was placed onto the center of one\\ncoupon and covered with the second identical coupon, with the\\nMC-coated side facing down, and a sterile weight was placed on\\nthe top to ensure complete contact between the two coupons. After\\n2 h of contact, the two test coupons were transferred to a sterile\\ntube containing 5 mL of 0.05 N sodium thiosulfate to quench the\\nactive chlorine residual from further disinfection. The tube was\\nvortexed vigorously to wash all remaining bacteria from the\\ncoupons into the solution, the solution was enriched for Salmonella\\nusing the FSIS MLG method (24), and the bacterial level was\\ndetermined according to the following procedures. Ten-fold serial\\ndilutions were made, each dilution was plated on TSA with 100\\nppm of NA, plates were incubated at 378C for 24 h, and colonies\\non plates were enumerated and recorded for analysis. The method\\nused to test the biocidal activity against C. jejuni was the same as\\nthat used for Salmonella Typhimurium. In this study, treatments\\nwere conducted in triplicate, and the test was repeated twice.\\nDetermination of active chlorine concentration in MC-\\ncoated coupons. A modiﬁed iodometric thiosulfate titration\\nmethod (29) was used to determine the active chlorine concentra-\\ntion on the MC-treated surfaces. Coupons were immersed in a\\nsolution containing potassium iodide, acetic acid, and absolute\\nethanol, standardized sodium thiosulfate was used to titrate the\\nsolution until the color changed from yellow to colorless, and the\\nconsumption of sodium thiosulfate was recorded. The titration was\\nrepeated three times. The average volume of the titrant was used\\nfor chlorine calculation according to the following equation (6):\\nClþ ðatom=cm2Þ ¼ 6:02 3 1023 3 N 3 V\\n2A\\nwhere N and V are the normality (eq/L) and volume (L) of the\\nsodium thiosulfate, respectively, and A is the surface area (cm2) of\\nthe coupon.\\nData analysis. One-way analyses of variance and Dunnett’s\\ntests (SAS v. 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) were used to determine\\nthe antimicrobial activity of MC and its treated materials.\\nSigniﬁcance was deﬁned at a 95% conﬁdence level.\\nRESULTS\\nAntimicrobial activity in aqueous solution.

MC at 0.06% caused a signiﬁcant reduction (1\\nlog CFU per coupon; P , 0.05) of the bacteria at 5 min and\\na 2-log reduction at 10 min. When the contact time was\\nextended to 30 min, the 0.02 and 0.04% treatments resulted\\nin 1- and 2.4-log reductions, respectively. The 0.06% MC\\ntreatment resulted in a 6.5-log reduction, which means the\\ninoculated bacteria were completely inactivated. After 1 h,\\nthe 0.04% MC treatment also completely inactivated the\\ninoculated Salmonella Typhimurium (6.5-log reduction).\\nFor C. jejuni (Fig. 3B), 0.06% MC solution caused a\\nsigniﬁcant reduction (4.3 log CFU per coupon) of the\\nbacteria in 5 min and complete inactivation (6.3-log\\nreduction) in 10 min.

For the ﬁrst 3 days after the initial application of MC,\\nthe concentration of active chlorine on the ﬁve tested\\nmaterials stayed the same (3 3 1016 to 4 3 1016 atoms per\\ncm2) (Table 1). On day 6, the remaining chlorine\\nconcentration on aluminum decreased from 3 3 1016 to 2\\n3 1016 atoms per cm2, but chlorine on other materials\\nleveled off. There was still no signiﬁcant reduction of active\\nchlorine concentration until day 21, when the chlorine was\\nreduced to 1 3 1016 atoms per cm2 on aluminum, plastic,\\nand pressure-treated wood and 2 3 1016 atoms per cm2 on\\nother materials. On day 28, the chlorine concentration was\\n,1016 atoms per cm2 on both plastic and pressure-treated\\nwood but still enough to completely inactivate all the\\nmicroorganisms. In general, chlorine concentration was not\\nsigniﬁcantly reduced until day 21 (except for on aluminum)\\nand then decreased slightly over a 4-week storage period in\\nthe dark.\\nAntimicrobial longevity of MC-coated materials. On\\nstainless steel treated with 1% MC, inoculated Salmonella\\nTyphimurium and C. jejuni were completely inactivated by\\nthe end of 4 weeks of storage (Fig. 4A1 and 4B1). On the\\nstainless steel treated with 0.1% MC the inoculated\\nSalmonella Typhimurium was inactivated completely (5.3-\\nlog reduction) on the initial day and 3 days later. The\\nantimicrobial activity then decreased to a 0.1-log reduction\\non day 6. The 0.1% MC on stainless steel had continuous\\nantimicrobial activity against C. jejuni during the 4-week\\nstudy period but decreased over time. Overall, the MC\\nantimicrobial activity was higher against C. jejuni than\\nagainst Salmonella Typhimurium.\\nOn galvanized metal coated with 1% MC, the\\ninoculated bacteria were completely inactivated during the\\n4-week storage period (Fig. 4A2 and 4B2). On samples\\ntreated with 0.1% MC, Salmonella Typhimurium was\\nsigniﬁcantly affected initially (1.5-log reduction; P ,\\n0.05), and then the antimicrobial activity decreased over\\ntime up to 21 days. Inoculated C. jejuni was not detected in\\nany of the MC-treated groups or the untreated control group.\\nOn aluminum treated with 1% MC, the inoculated\\nbacteria were completely inactivated at each test day during\\nthe 4-week of storage period (Fig. 4A3 and 4B3). On\\nsamples treated with 0.1% MC, Salmonella Typhimurium\\nwas signiﬁcantly affected initially (4-log reduction), and\\nthen the antimicrobial activity decreased to a 0.4-log\\nreduction on day 6. On the day of treatment, the 0.1% MC\\nsolution inactivated all C. jejuni (5.8-log reduction). Unlike\\nthe MC-coated galvanized metal, the antimicrobial activity\\nof the MC-coated aluminum was similar against both C.\\njejuni and Salmonella Typhimurium.\\nLike the other materials, plastics treated with 1% MC\\ninactivated all inoculated Salmonella Typhimurium and C.\\njejuni, and the antimicrobial activity lasted through 4 weeks\\n(Fig. 4A4 and 4B4). On samples treated with 0.1% MC,\\nsigniﬁcant antimicrobial activity against Salmonella Typhi-\\nmurium and C. jejuni was noted on the ﬁrst day of treatment,\\nwith 3.4-log reductions of Salmonella and 4.2-log reductions\\n(complete inactivation) of C. jejuni.\\nOn pressure-treated wood coated with 1% MC, the\\ninoculated Salmonella Typhimurium was completely inac-\\ntivated, and the effect lasted up to 4 weeks (Fig. 4A5).

A\\nhigher concentration of MC and longer contact time\\nenhanced the antimicrobial efﬁcacy, which is in agreement\\nwith results of a previous study (6). In the present study, MC\\nat a lower concentration (0.02%) was still able to effectively\\ninactivate Salmonella Typhimurium and C. jejuni in a short\\nperiod of time.\\nTo further assess the antimicrobial efﬁcacy of MC in the\\nﬁeld, antimicrobial longevity and stability tests were\\nperformed on MC-treated facility surfaces. For all of the\\nmaterials treated with 1% MC, the inoculated microorgan-\\nisms were completely inactivated on each test day during 4\\nweeks of storage, which indicates that the antimicrobial\\nactivity of MC is quite stable on facility and equipment\\nsurfaces. This stability may be attributed to the speciﬁc\\namine structure MC; methyl groups are located on the\\ncarbon ring adjacent to the N-Cl moiety, which can stabilize\\nthe N-Cl bond either by steric hindrance or by the electron\\ndonor effect of the methyl groups (11).\\nCompared with the disinfectants currently used in\\nbroiler houses (8, 17, 20), the MC compound has higher\\nantimicrobial effectiveness and offers other advantages.\\nSpeciﬁcally, chlorine-based products, such as sodium\\nhypochlorite, can lose their disinfection power in the\\npresence of organic matter (19). Quaternary ammonium\\ncompounds are not recommended for use in poultry\\nproduction because of their insufﬁcient disinfectant activity\\nagainst Salmonella Typhimurium (16). In addition to the\\ninadequate antibacterial effectiveness of these compounds,\\ntheir pungent odors, corrosiveness, and short shelf life are\\nother disadvantages. Formaldehyde and peroxygen com-\\npounds also are used in broiler houses by fogging. However,\\nformaldehyde is not permitted for use in poultry production\\nin the United States because of personnel safety concerns\\n(5). Results from this study revealed that MC is stable and\\nhas a long-lasting antimicrobial effect when coated on\\ncontact surfaces. It is not corrosive to equipment surfaces\\nand does not have a pungent odor. These characteristics\\nsuggest that MC is an outstanding candidate for use as an\\nantimicrobial agent in broiler houses.\\nThe antimicrobial activity of MC is related to its\\nchlorine concentration. Results of a previous study indicated\\nthat effective antimicrobial activity (a 6-log reduction per\\ncoupon) required active chlorine at 1017 atoms per cm2 (18).\\nIn the present study, even when the active chlorine\\nconcentration was decreased to 5.85 3 1015 atoms per\\ncm2, MC was still able to completely inactivate the\\ninoculated Salmonella Typhimurium and C. jejuni at 6 log\\nCFU per coupon.\\nIn this study, C. jejuni was not detected on galvanized\\nmetal and pressure-treated wood, probably due to the\\nstructure and property of these two materials. Galvanized\\nmetal is usually produced by submerging steel or iron in\\nmolten zinc to prevent rusting. Zinc and zinc oxide have\\nantimicrobial activity against several foodborne pathogens\\n(14); therefore, the inactivation of Campylobacter on the\\ngalvanized metal might be due to the presence of the zinc\\ncoating. Pressure-treated wood contains chemicals used as\\npreservatives to prevent rot from microbial infection. The\\nchemicals in the pressure-treated wood may also have\\ninactivated the inoculated C. jejuni. Repeated experiments\\nproduced the same result. The mechanism is not yet clear,\\nbut a previous study also revealed that the MIC of ZnO\\nnanoparticles for C. jejuni was 8- to 16-fold lower than that\\nfor Salmonella (30).\\nThe construction materials tested in this study were\\nchosen because they are the most commonly used materials\\nin broiler houses. Microbial cross-contamination from feed\\nor other organic matter in a chicken house is unlikely on\\nthese materials, which is why we did not perform an\\nantimicrobial assay with organic matter on the coated\\nmaterials. The antimicrobial activity tests in this study could\\nbe used to predict the effectiveness of MC in the ﬁeld.\\nResults revealed that the antimicrobial efﬁcacy differed\\nbased on the material, which is consistent with the active\\nchlorine loadings on the coated surfaces. These differences\\ncan be explained by the differences in structure and surface\\ncharacteristics of each material, which may affect their\\nability to retain MC compounds on their surfaces. The\\nroughness of the surface may inﬂuence the attachment of\\nMC molecules to the material, resulting in variations in\\nantimicrobial activity.\\nIn conclusion, MC had outstanding nonantibiotic\\nantimicrobial activity and could lower microbial loads in\\npoultry houses through application to the surfaces of\\nfacilities and equipment, such as water and feeder systems.\\nThe antimicrobial effects of MC were highly stable during\\nthe 4-week storage period and last longer than those of most\\ncurrently used disinfectants.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nThis material is based upon work that is supported in part by the\\nAlabama Agricultural Experiment Station.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. 2012.

Egg and meat production are \\nthe two primary functions of the poultry business. \\nTraditionally, a poultry farm contained few hundred birds \\nand all the task of poultry farm management including the \\nlivestock \\nmonitoring \\nwere \\nperformed \\nby \\nhuman \\nworkers[1][2]. But as the demand for poultry products \\nincreased so is the size of the poultry farms. Due to fragile \\nand disease prone nature of the chickens and hens, it is \\nessential to monitor the livestock at the individual bird \\nlevel so that the symptoms of different diseases can be \\ndetected in time for containing the disease outbreak. \\nObviously, if the farm is managed by human workers \\nalone, the required number of workers to monitor the \\nlivestock on individual bird level is substantially higher, \\nthat in turn results in the escalation of production costs. \\nAlso, due to the engagement of more number of human \\nworkers the natural habitat of poultry birds gets affected  \\n \\nby human workers. Additionally, it raises concerns about \\nthe health of workers in the poultry business. As most of \\nthe diseases in poultry birds are highly contagious and \\ncommunicable, these affect humans too. It becomes a very \\ndangerous situation in case any fatal disease originates in \\npoultry.  \\nThis whole scenario creates a need to employ modern \\ntechnology solutions. Different sensors, cameras, and \\nmicrophones can be used for poultry health monitoring \\nand management, thereby reducing the risks to human \\nhealth, as by employing technology human interference in \\nlivestock monitoring can be reduced to minimal. Also, the \\nefficiency of the overall system and timely detection of \\nany disease/disorder or behavioral problem in poultry will \\nbe improved. \\n \\nThe Poultry industry in India lies in the \\nunorganized sector but it has witnessed steady growth \\nsince the introduction of 1991 new economic policy [3]. \\nRecently a report by The National Environmental \\nEngineering Research Institute (NEERI) [29] estimated \\nthe total poultry population in India to be 729.2 million. \\nAs compared to the last Livestock Census 2012, the figure \\nis 12.39% higher. India is the fastest-growing egg \\nproducer in the world. As per the World Egg Organization \\n(WEO) India has already, (overcome the USA), to be \\nnumber 2nd egg-producing country, and only lacking \\nChina in terms of the numbers of eggs produced each \\nyear. India is adding 3 Billion eggs in its total production \\nevery year[29]. The most common poultry breeds in India \\nare : \\n1) Ovens: Ovens are developed from an incubate weight \\nof 40 g to a load of roughly 1.5 to 2 kg. The time \\ntaken for gaining weight is about a month and a half.  \\n2) Layers: Hens utilized for business egg generation and \\nafterward executed for meat. Layer chickens are raised \\nfrom one day old. They start laying eggs at the age of \\n18-19 weeks and proceed till they are 72-78 weeks of \\nage \\n \\nIn spite of this impressive growth in numbers, India is \\nperforming dismally as compared to developed countries \\n\\x02\\x03\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05\\x06\\x06\\x06\\x04\\x05\\x07\\x08\\t\\n\\x07\\x0b\\x08\\x0c\\r\\x07\\x0b\\x0e\\x04\\x0f\\r\\x07\\x10\\t\\n\\t\\x07\\x11\\t\\x04\\r\\x07\\x04\\x0f\\r\\x12\\x12\\x13\\x07\\x0c\\x11\\x0b\\x08\\x0c\\r\\x07\\x14\\x04\\x15\\t\\x08\\x16\\r\\n\\x17\\x18\\x04\\x0b\\x07\\x19\\x04\\x1a\\x0b\\x08\\t\\x0e\\x0e\\x0c\\x08\\t\\x04\\x1b\\x0f\\r\\x12\\x07\\t\\x08\\x18\\x0b\\x08\\x1c\\n\\x1d\\x1e\\x1f \\x03 \\x1e!\\x1f\" \\x02#\"\\x1e $%\\x02\\x03%&!\"\\'\\x03\\x03\\x04(\\x02\\x03\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05\\x06\\x06\\x06\\n50\\n2020 IEEE International Conference on Communication, Networks and Satellite (Comnetsat) | 978-0-7381-2517-6/20/$31.00 ©2020 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/Comnetsat50391.2020.9328930\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO.

Most of the small/medium scale poultry farms apply \\nminimal to almost zero modern solutions to run their day \\nto day operations. The general lack of awareness on the \\npart of poultry farm owners and the absence of developing \\ncountry like India centric smart solutions for poultry \\nmanagement are the two most important reasons. Also, \\nmultiple factors contribute to the need for translational \\nresearch in the field of Precision Poultry Management and \\nAnimal Health Analytics [4]. Some of these are: \\n1. The demand for protein will far surpass the supply by \\n2050. \\n2. Highly contagious diseases and high-risk factor of \\nlosing the whole poultry crop. \\n3. Poultry products failing food safety norms due to the \\nunscientific administration of medicines for the \\ndisease cure. \\n4. Policy changes about the allowance of FDI in Poultry \\nIndustry. Poultry industry at multiple levels is seeing \\na barrage of global poultry houses entering India, \\nthereby increasing the market competition. \\n5. Innovation in poultry farm management that has \\nlargely been centered on the product and feed \\nprocess. \\nThe sizes of the poultry farms increased manifolds but the \\ntask of poultry health monitoring is still performed \\nthrough the intervention of humans only. Moreover, there \\nare thousands of birds reared in a small place so it is \\npractically infeasible to monitor each bird individually, \\nday in day out. Poultry farm owners are routinely facing \\nhuge loses as diseases get detected only when sizeable \\npoultry population gets effected.  To mitigate the effect, \\nthe solution they generally employs is to increase amount \\nof medicines and antibiotics. From human health point of \\nview, it is even more dangerous as increased use of \\nantibiotics compromises the product with respect to the \\nfood safety norms. \\n \\nApply \\nmodern \\ntechnology \\nsolutions \\nfor \\nimproving poultry production and profitability should \\nhave a multi dimensional approach. For example, from \\nproduction standpoint, each bird should be assessed based \\nupon individual body weights along with the water and \\nthe \\nfeed \\nconsumption. \\nFrom \\ndisease \\noutbreak \\nmanagement viewpoint, solution should have the \\ncapability to detect the disease and morbid bird as early as \\npossible. For maintaining food safety enhanced methods \\nfor Salmonella, Campylabacter and E.coli control[25][26]. \\nSimilarly, for animal welfare perspective, timely detection \\nof body comforts, stress levels and air quality parameters \\nlike carbon dioxide and ammonia levels.  Hence, in this \\npaper while considering all these parameters, we explored \\nthe avenues to develop an indigenous IoT based AI \\nequipped Pan-India system for modernizing Poultry \\nFarming on micro and macro levels.  \\nII. \\nIOT DEVICES-DEPLOYMENT OF \\nSENSORS/HARDWARE: \\n \\nDeploying readily available sensors for the purpose of \\nanimal farm modernization has been carried in many \\nstudies before.  In [4], authors have carried out \\nexperiments to remote monitor multiple environmental  \\nfactors of henhouses. A sensor network with online \\nwireless monitoring capabilities has been deployed. \\nThough sensors can accurately measure different \\nparameters, there performance in terms of the sensitivity \\nand efficiency vary with time. Hence different statistical \\nmethods \\nwere \\nemployed \\nin \\n[4][6][7] \\nfor \\ndata \\ncompensation, correction and fitting. Self decision and \\nonline filling provided efficient results. Nevertheless, the \\ncontinuous monitoring of deployed sensor is necessary for \\nmeasuring the accuracy. It is even more important in our \\ncase as the proposed system deploy the sensors that are \\nlow cost and readily available in the market. This includes \\nenvironmental monitoring such as temperature, pressure, \\nFigure 1.

Typically, \\nfor example, the gas sensor as described in [11] measure \\nthe toxic level of the air based upon the specified range, \\nlow value measure in particles per million (ppm) below a \\ncertain threshold is considered good and those above the \\nthreshold value, considered bad for the livestock rearing. \\nThe specified threshold value can be programmed and is a \\nfunction of the specific breed of the livestock. IoT set up \\nfor sensing the conditions based on video/image is \\ndescribed in detail (SECTION III). \\n \\nAs shown in Figure 1, the second important part \\nis algorithms that are applied to the large volume of data \\ncollected from the sensors for real-time monitoring and \\nprediction of the health status of animals. The richness of \\nmulti-dimensional \\ndata \\noffers \\nopportunities \\nand \\nchallenges in all three departments i.e. volume, variety, \\nand veracity[8][9]. For example, a single temporal video \\ndata taken in real-time (for a period of 7 days) with a \\nnormal frame rate which turns runs into GBs and it offers \\nchallenges in terms of sampling, storage, visualization and \\nintegration with other kinds of data like environmental \\nmonitoring [10]. On top of it developing machine learning \\nalgorithms is a challenge in itself due to the availability of \\ndifferent sensory modalities, feature selection and model \\nselection[13][14].  \\nThe third important part is the deployment of the \\nforecasting tools to the cloud. This will enable the \\ntechnology to be customizable and can be used on a \\ndemand basis from a web browser through a login portal.   \\nThe following are to be the primary requirements for the \\nend-end solution to Poultry Farmers and Integrators \\npowered using Artificial Intelligence. \\n1. Digitizing total farm operations and collection of \\ndata.  \\n2. Deploying sensors to collect invaluable information \\nat the farm and animal level for real-time automated \\nmonitoring of farm environment, animal productivity, \\nand animal health. \\n3. Creating \\na \\ncloud-based, \\nRESTFul-API \\ndriven \\ninfrastructure that facilitates the data collection and \\nmanagement. \\n4. Creating Machine Learning Models to understand, \\npredict and recommend action for farm management. \\n5. Develop and deploy the software, dashboards, and \\nvisualizations \\nrequired \\nto \\nmonitor \\npoultry \\nmanagement operations at an industrial scale. \\n \\nDeveloping cloud IoT based Livestock Management \\nSystem is a different challenge altogether, as till now there \\nexists no uniform opinion on its architecture. The general \\ndeployment strategy is to make different subsystems \\n(smart devices) exiting within the system interacts directly \\nwith the physical world. This constitutes the front end of \\nthe whole system. Cloud end necessarily includes the \\nstorage, AI aware computing and system execution \\ncontrols \\nand \\nacts \\nlike \\nthe \\nback \\nend \\nsupport. \\nCommunication infrastructure associated with smart \\ndevices and the back end cloud operations constitutes the \\nnetwork end. Accordingly authors in [6] divide the cloud \\ninfrastructure into two categories: object centric and cloud \\noriented IoT architecture. Similarly, [7] suggests Iot cloud \\nplatform consisting of four layers, Cloud Storage, \\nGateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud \\nstorage stores and aggregates all the data from sensors and \\nprovides \\non \\ndemand \\nservice \\nthrough \\nnetworked \\ninfrastructure. We believe that Representational state \\ntransfer (RESTFul) API driven architecture as proposed in \\nour system is an ideal solution for IoT cloud development. \\nRESTFul API supports data scalability, flexibility, \\nportability and development of different IoT subsystems \\nindependently.  It uses HTTP requests to access and use \\ndata as defined by the RFC 2616 protocol. Cloud Data \\nManagement \\nInterface \\n(CDMI), \\nAmazon \\nS3 \\nand \\nOpenStack Swift RESTFul API cloud storage services can \\nbe used for actual deployment [30].         \\nIII. \\nVIDEO/IMAGE FOR POULTRY FARM ANALYSIS \\n \\nAs shown in Figure. 2, the machine learning technology \\nusing poultry big data along with the camera sensing \\ntechnology can be used to detect the suspected disease \\nsymptoms. A similar system has been employed in \\n[18][25]. Camera-based technologies such as object \\nrecognition and abnormal motion detection algorithm for \\nchickens can be used to study areas related to chicken \\nhealth, nutrition, stress level, behavior, environment, and \\ndiseases. A few image examination procedures have been \\nconcentrated to screen domesticated animals, including \\nimage investigation, optical stream, and infrared imaging \\nin [7] and [16]. By utilizing optical stream imaging \\nmethod that can quantify changes in splendor in a \\nprogression \\nof \\nan \\nimage, \\ncontamination \\nwith \\nCampylobacter in chickens can be recognized in [16]. \\nCampylobacter strongly affects the welfare of the birds as \\nsolid provocative conditions can prompt looseness of the \\nbowels, poor litter quality, and decayed strolling capacity \\nin influenced feathered creatures like chickens and hens. \\nIn [13], for the predict health and welfare continuously, \\nthe combination of Optical flow and Bayesian regression \\nhas been used. Also, Optical Flow is used to predict \\nplumage damage and management and/or environmental \\nrisk factors in laying hens as described by the authors in \\n[14] and [26]. This model shows a better prediction of \\nfeather damage and excellent identification of high \\nprevalent damaged flocks. \\n \\nDisease immunity development in the livestock \\nis another important factor. Infrared Thermal Imaging can \\nbe used to prevent heat stress which is very important to \\npoultry welfare as it can have a deep impact on bird \\nimmunity, and health and can cause major mortalities. The \\nmeasured data can be used to maintain the ambient \\ntemperature of the poultry farm. Superficial body \\ntemperature can be detected using Infrared thermal \\nimaging (IRTI) technology. This is a non-invasive \\ntechnique in which different body temperature is \\nrepresented in the form of different colors which can be \\nused to detect fever indicating the onset of disease [8]. \\nSeveral studies are indicating a strong relationship \\n\\x02\\x03\\x02\\x03\\x04\\x05\\x06\\x06\\x06\\x04\\x05\\x07\\x08\\t\\n\\x07\\x0b\\x08\\x0c\\r\\x07\\x0b\\x0e\\x04\\x0f\\r\\x07\\x10\\t\\n\\t\\x07\\x11\\t\\x04\\r\\x07\\x04\\x0f\\r\\x12\\x12\\x13\\x07\\x0c\\x11\\x0b\\x08\\x0c\\r\\x07\\x14\\x04\\x15\\t\\x08\\x16\\r\\n\\x17\\x18\\x04\\x0b\\x07\\x19\\x04\\x1a\\x0b\\x08\\t\\x0e\\x0e\\x0c\\x08\\t\\x04\\x1b\\x0f\\r\\x12\\x07\\t\\x08\\x18\\x0b\\x08\\x1c\\n52\\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO.

Many researchers \\nbelieve that much more information about bird’s condition \\ncan be recorded using facial surface temperature than the \\nambient temperature and, thus, has great prospects to be \\nimplemented at a commercial level to monitor thermal \\nstress levels. Identification of a dead chicken can be done \\nby using image technology. An automatic detection \\nalgorithm based on a support vector machine (SVM) has \\nbeen used to detect dead chicken [10]. \\n \\nIV. Vocalization (Sound) based analysis of Chicken in \\nthe Poultry industry \\nCharacteristics of the sounds emitted by birds can be used \\nto understand the biological significance of living \\norganisms. In particular, for social interactions birds are \\nknown to rely upon acoustic communication and also use \\nsounds for signaling alarms. Some of the bird sounds can \\nalso be considered as indicators of stress and so that these \\nsounds can be used in an interesting approach to study the \\nwelfare assessment indicators of the birds. This can be \\nused to increase productivity in the poultry industry. \\nChickens are known to make sounds that can unveil a \\nsubstantial amount of information about their health and \\nhappiness. Chicken produces sounds like clucks, chortles, \\nand caws which can divulge their happiness. Certain \\nSounds of chickens can also indicate diseases. Moreover, \\nrespiratory diseases are a major health challenge in meat \\nchicken production. Sounds of rales and sneeze may give \\nalert for a rise in symptoms related to respiratory infection \\nin the chickens. Sounds of high pitched shrieks can \\nindicate a predator and these sounds can be considered as \\na signal of distress. Also the time of the day is a factor for \\nsound level in poultry. Chickens are generally noisier in \\nthe morning and are much more silent in the night. So any \\ndeviation in the behavior can be considered abnormality \\nwhich can be used to alert the poultry supervisor. \\nThere is a need to implement sound recognition \\ntechnology and robust algorithms to ensure the precision \\nto recognize the chicken sounds which can be used to \\nunderstand and predict the information related to chicken \\ndiseases, behavior, weight, age, happiness, and well-\\nbeing. It is seen that generally, the poultry farms are noisy \\ndue to the sound of large fans for air circulation which \\nmakes detection of chicken sounds a challenge for \\nresearchers to filter out the noise component and extract \\nthe chicken sounds. There is a need for a robust and \\naccurate \\nchicken \\nsound \\nrecognition \\ntechnique. \\nResearchers have used sound recognition technology to \\ndetect chicken sound in presence of large background \\nnoise which is based on the Anti-noise Mel Frequency  \\n \\n \\n \\nCepstral Coefficients (AMFCC), MFCC and PNCC \\nparameters to improve signal to noise ratio [11-12]. \\nModified Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been used to \\nstudy the effect of vocalization with the level of stress in \\nchicken [13]. The analysis of chicken sounds can be used \\nto estimate the weight and age of chickens [14]. Also, the \\nsounds of chicken can be used to detect the occurrence of \\nfeather pecking in chicken. Feather pecking is known for \\nthe behavioral problems in chicken which occurs when \\none chicken frequently pecks the feathers of another \\nchicken. This can cause injury and even death of the bird. \\nThere has been a noteworthy amount of research done to \\nstudy the link between chicken diseases and their \\nvocalization. Vocalization analysis can be used for timely \\nidentification and diagnosis of infectious diseases in \\nchicken. The sound analysis can be implemented to detect \\nthe sounds of rales which can be a sign of high and low \\npathogenic Avian Influenza virus infection in broilers \\n[18][19]. The sound of sneezing in chicken can be an \\nindication of several respiratory-related problems. The \\nrecorded sounds of sneezing can be labeled after filtering \\nthe raw sounds which enable an algorithm to classify \\nsneeze sounds [20][22]. Also the sounds of chickens \\ninfected with Clostridium Perfringens were compared \\nwith a healthy chicken sounds [23]. The analysis was done \\nbased on Fisher's discriminate analysis and five specific \\nfeatures were extracted to show a large difference of \\nsounds between healthy and infected chickens. \\n \\nInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) affects the \\nchicken sounds and recording of infected chicken can be \\nused to manually label the sounds which can be used to \\ntrain the algorithm. The trained algorithm can be used to \\nFigure 2.

In intensively\\nreared food animals, antibiotics may be administered to\\nwhole ﬂocks rather than individual animals. In addition,\\nantimicrobial agents may be continuously fed to food \\nanimals such as broilers and turkeys as antimicrobial\\ngrowth promoters (AMGP). Therefore the antibiotic selec-\\ntion pressure for resistance in bacteria in poultry is high and\\nconsequently their faecal ﬂora contains a relatively high\\nproportion of resistant bacteria.9 However, as most AMGP\\ncommonly used in The Netherlands until recently are effec-\\ntive mainly against Gram-positive bacteria, most resistance\\nin faecal Escherichia coli of food animals is to antibiotics\\nused on veterinary prescription.\\nAt slaughter, resistant strains from the gut readily soil\\npoultry carcasses and as a result poultry meats are often\\ncontaminated with multiresistant E. coli;10–16 likewise \\neggs become contaminated during laying.17 Hence, resist-\\nant faecal E. coli from poultry can infect humans both\\ndirectly and via food. These resistant bacteria may colonize\\nthe human intestinal tract and may also contribute resist-\\nance genes to human endogenous ﬂora.\\nHowever, the mechanism of spread of antibiotic resist-\\nance from food animals to humans remains controversial.\\n763\\nAntibiotic resistance of faecal Escherichia coli in poultry, poultry\\nfarmers and poultry slaughterers\\nA. E. van den Bogaard, N. London, C. Driessen and E. E. Stobberingh*\\nUniversity Hospital Maastricht, Department of Medical Microbiology, PO Box 5800, 6202 AZ Maastricht, \\nThe Netherlands\\nThe percentage of faecal samples containing resistant Echerichia coli and the proportion of\\nresistant faecal E. coli were determined in three poultry populations: broilers and turkeys \\ncommonly given antibiotics, and laying hens treated with antibiotics relatively infrequently.\\nFaecal samples of ﬁve human populations were also examined: turkey farmers, broiler farmers,\\nlaying-hen farmers, broiler slaughterers and turkey slaughterers. The MICs of antibiotics com-\\nmonly used in poultry medicine were also determined. Ciproﬂoxacin-resistant isolates from\\nthese eight populations and from turkey meat were genotyped by pulsed-ﬁeld gel electro-\\nphoresis (PFGE) after SmaI digestion. The proportion of samples containing resistant E. coli\\nand the percentages of resistant E. coli were signiﬁcantly higher in turkeys and broilers than in\\nthe laying-hen population. Resistance to nearly all antibiotics in faecal E. coli of turkey and\\nbroiler farmers, and of turkey and broiler slaughterers, was higher than in laying-hen farmers.\\nMultiresistant isolates were common in turkey and broiler farmers but absent in laying-hen\\nfarmers. The same resistance patterns were found in turkeys, turkey farmers and turkey\\nslaughterers and in broiler, broiler farmers and broiler slaughterers. The PFGE patterns of the\\nisolates from the eight populations were quite heterogeneous, but E. coli with an identical\\nPFGE pattern were isolated at two farms from a turkey and the farmer, and also from a broiler\\nand a broiler farmer from different farms. Moreover, three E. coli isolates from turkey meat were\\nidentical to faecal isolates from turkeys.

E. van den Bogaard et al.\\nColonization of the intestinal tract with resistant E. coli\\nfrom chicken has been shown in human volunteers.18\\nEvidence that animals are a reservoir for E. coli found in\\nhumans was published by Cooke et al.19 in the early 1970s.\\nSpread of an antibiotic resistance plasmid, pSL222-6, in \\nE. coli from chickens to human handlers was described by\\nLevy et al.20 Others have also presented evidence of spread\\nof antibiotic-resistant microorganisms from poultry to\\nhumans in various countries. Linton et al.13,18 found the\\nsame O serotype in chickens from a commercial rearing\\ncentre, in oven-ready birds and in humans. Ojeniyi21,22\\ndescribed direct transmission of E. coli resistant to strepto-\\nmycin, sulphonamides and tetracycline from poultry to\\npoultry attendants in Nigeria. Chickens have also been\\ndescribed as a source of antibiotic resistance in humans in\\nnorthern India,23 Morocco24 and Saudi Arabia.25 Recently,\\nBass et al.26 described a high incidence of integrons encod-\\ning multidrug resistance among chicken isolates as part \\nof transposon Tn21. In addition, they described the dis-\\nsemination of Tn21 among pathogenic poultry isolates and\\nsuggest that Tn21 may transfer between pathogenic micro-\\norganisms in humans as well as in poultry.\\nIn contrast, others have concluded that human and poul-\\ntry isolates belong to two distinct pools of resistant E. coli.\\nSmith27 concluded that the antibiotic resistance transfer\\nbetween animals and humans was limited and that animal\\nstrains colonized the alimentary tract less readily than\\nhuman ones. He stated that in view of the high prevalence\\nof antibiotic resistance in humans, animals are not an\\nimportant source of resistant E. coli in man. Shooter et al.28\\nserotyped animal and human E. coli isolates using 150 O\\nantisera. Of the animal strains, 289 (36%) of 798 could be\\nserotyped, whereas only two of 1580 human isolates could\\nnot be typed.28 They concluded that O serotypes of animal\\norigin may differ from those of humans. Differences in\\nchloramphenicol and streptomycin resistance between\\npoultry and their attendants in North India has been\\ndescribed29—26 versus 58% for chloramphenicol and 69\\nversus 94% for streptomycin. In female poultry workers\\nexposed to resistant microorganisms of animal origin but\\nwho had not received antibiotics, urinary tract infections\\nwere infrequently caused by poultry strains. A more detailed\\nanalysis using restriction enzyme analysis of plasmid DNA\\nshowed that none of the plasmids from human isolates\\nappeared to be related to any of the poultry isolates.30 Caya\\net al.31 compared the phenotypes and genotypes of E. coli\\nisolates from sick broilers in abattoirs in the province of\\nQuebec with human isolates from hospitalized patients \\nliving in the same locality as the abattoir. A higher preva-\\nlence of resistance was found among the poultry isolates\\nespecially to gentamicin, spectinomycin, tetracycline and\\nsulphamethoxazole. Only two poultry isolates demon-\\nstrated a possible relationship with human strains. Com-\\nparing E. coli from a poultry processing plant in Kenya and\\nisolates from children with diarrhoea living in close contact\\nwith poultry, Kariuki et al.32 observed differences in anti-\\nbiotic resistance patterns and in the levels of multidrug\\nresistance. The authors concluded that human and poultry\\nisolates carry two distinct pools of resistance plasmids. A\\nsimilar conclusion was drawn by Nijsten et al.33 comparing\\nresistance patterns of faecal E. coli isolates of pig farmers\\nand their pigs.\\nIn this study the prevalence of resistance in faecal E. coli\\nwas analysed in the following populations: broilers and\\nturkeys, both with relatively high antibiotic use, and laying\\nhens with relatively low antibiotic use. To study the pos-\\nsible dissemination of resistant E. coli or resistance genes\\nfrom these poultry populations to humans, the farmers par-\\nticipating in the study were also requested to submit faecal\\nsamples. The faecal ﬂora of turkey and poultry slaughterers\\nwas also studied. Farmers have daily contact with their \\nanimals and are directly exposed to animal faeces, and\\nslaughterers have daily contact with poultry carcasses or\\nmeat. All faecal samples were analysed in terms of the\\nprevalence and degree of resistance in E. coli.\\nAs the possibility of transfer of ciproﬂoxacin-resistant\\nbacteria from animals to humans is controversial, cipro-\\nﬂoxacin-resisant E. coli isolates from poultry and humans\\nand turkey carcasses were genotyped using PFGE.\\nMaterials and methods\\nCollection of faecal samples\\nFresh faecal samples were collected from farmers keeping\\neither turkeys, broilers or hens producing eggs for human\\nconsumption in the south of The Netherlands. The farmers\\nwere requested to provide one fresh faecal sample from\\nthemselves and a mixed faecal sample from the oldest ﬂock\\nof poultry at the farm and to send these on the day of col-\\nlection with the completed questionnaire to the bacteri-\\nology laboratory. In the questionnaire information was\\nasked about other animals kept at the farm, recent hospital\\nstay and antibiotic usage by themselves, family members or\\ntheir animals during the 3 months preceding the sample\\ncollection. In addition, poultry slaughterers working at a\\npoultry-processing plant in a similar area were asked to sub-\\nmit a faecal specimen and to ﬁll in the same questionnaire.\\nThe faecal samples from the turkey farmers, their turkeys\\nand the turkey slaughterers were processed in a manner\\nsimilar to that described previously.34 On the day of arrival\\nat the laboratory the samples were diluted (10\\x031) in 0.9%\\nNaCl containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and stored at \\x0320\\x04C\\nuntil assayed.

Forty-seven samples from turkey slaughterers were\\nalso received. Response rates in poultry slaughterers and\\npoultry farmers were about 50% and 30%, respectively. In\\ntotal, faecal samples from 46 poultry slaughterers, 51\\nbroiler farmers and 50 broilers, 25 laying-hen farmers and\\n25 laying hens were received. One broiler farmer had no\\nbroilers on the farm at the time of sample collection and\\nonly sent his own faecal sample. None of the turkey farmers\\nand slaughterers or their family members had been hos-\\npitalized or used antibiotics in the 3 months preceding \\nsample collection. Two poultry slaughterers and one laying-\\nhen farmer had been hospitalized. Antibiotic use was \\nmentioned by four broiler farmers and four slaughterers\\nand by two of their respective family members. None of the\\nlaying-hen farmers had used antibiotics but a few family\\nmembers had.\\nPrevalence of resistance\\nOf the three poultry populations, the highest prevalence\\nand degree of resistance to almost all compounds tested\\nwas detected in turkey samples, closely followed by those\\nfrom broilers and distinctly lower in the laying-hen popu-\\nlation (Table I). The prevalence of resistance to cipro-\\nﬂoxacin, ﬂumequine and neomycin was signiﬁcantly higher\\n(P \\x07 0.005) in turkeys and broilers than in laying hens.\\nNitrofurantoin resistance was found only in turkey isolates.\\nFor amoxycillin and oxytetracycline the percentage of \\nsamples with a high degree of resistance among turkey and\\nbroiler isolates was signiﬁcantly higher (P \\x07 0.005), com-\\npared with laying hens.\\nIn the human populations the same tendency was\\nobserved. Turkey farmers showed the highest percentage\\nresistance to all agents tested both in terms of prevalence\\nand high degree of resistance. The lowest resistance rates\\nwere observed in the laying-hen farmers. The prevalence of\\nresistance in turkey and broiler farmers was signiﬁcantly\\nhigher compared with laying-hen farmers for amoxycillin,\\nciproﬂoxacin, ﬂumequine, neomycin, oxytetracycline and\\ntrimethoprim. In the human populations tested, high-level\\nquinolone resistance was found only in turkey and broiler\\nfarmers. The resistance rates in turkey slaughterers and\\npoultry slaughterers were similar, resistance to neomycin\\nexcepted, which was signiﬁcantly lower in turkey slaughter-\\ners (P \\x07 0.05). The resistance was signiﬁcantly higher in\\nslaughterers than in laying-hen farmers to neomycin and\\noxytetracycline. The percentage of high-level resistance\\nwas signiﬁcantly higher to oxytetracycline and trimetho-\\nprim and in broiler slaughterers only, also for amoxycillin\\nand neomycin (P \\x07 0.05).\\nAntibiotic susceptibility\\nIn approximately 10% of the human and animal samples no\\nE. coli grew on the antibiotic-free control plate, which\\nmeans that fewer than 300 cfu of E. coli (minimum detection\\nlevel) were present per gram of faeces. Antibiotic suscept-\\nibility testing of the E. coli isolates showed resistance to ﬁve\\nor more antibiotics, with the highest frequency in isolates\\nfrom turkeys (32%), followed by broilers (23%) and broiler\\nfarmers (22%) as shown in Table II. The majority of the\\nisolates from laying hens and laying-hen farmers were \\nsusceptible to all compounds tested (65 and 55%, respec-\\ntively). For the turkey and broiler isolates these percent-\\nages were signiﬁcantly lower (16 and 20%, respectively).\\nThe most prevalent resistance patterns of each popu-\\nlation are compared in Table III. The resistance patterns\\nmost frequently observed, especially among turkeys,\\nturkey farmers and turkey slaughterers, were resistance to\\namoxycillin alone and in combination with oxytetracycline,\\nstreptomycin, sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Single\\nresistance to oxytetracycline was present in almost all \\npopulations studied, laying-hen farmers excepted, but in\\ncombination with amoxycillin mainly in turkeys.\\nThe most frequent pattern in laying-hen farmers, i.e.\\nresistance to streptomycin and sulphamethoxazole, was not\\nfound among laying-hen isolates. The resistance patterns in\\nturkeys corresponded to those in turkey farmers and\\nslaughterers and those of broilers were in general also pre-\\nsent in broiler farmers and slaughterers. No ciproﬂoxacin\\nresistance was observed in these single isolates of E. coli.\\nPFGE patterns\\nThe PFGE patterns obtained with the ciproﬂoxacin-resistant\\nisolates from turkeys (n \\x08 21), turkey farmers (n \\x08 11),\\nbroilers (n \\x08 25) and broiler farmers (n \\x08 4) were quite\\nheterogeneous.

However, for poultry it is more than 400\\nmg/kg/year, which is considerable higher than in other \\nanimals.7\\nThe major factor selecting for antimicrobial resistance in\\nbacteria is antibiotic use, and additionally, crowding and\\npoor sanitation. These three factors are typical of intensive\\npoultry farming and explain the high prevalence and\\ndegree of resistance in faecal E. coli of poultry in this and\\nother studies.9 Ojeniyi21 found all 3444 E. coli isolates from\\nbattery hens to be multiresistant but none of 2284 isolates\\nfrom free-range chickens. Antibiotics are seldom given to\\nlaying hens producing eggs for human consumption: bac-\\nterial infections occur less frequently in these than in young\\nbroilers as farmers are reluctant to give antibiotics because\\nof the possibility of antibiotic residues in eggs. However,\\nduring rearing, antibiotics are commonly used and resist-\\nance in E. coli in the avian intestinal tract may persist for \\na long time even in the absence of antibiotics.44 Faecal \\nsamples were collected from the oldest birds because these\\nreﬂect the chance of contamination of eggs and poultry\\nmeat during slaughtering.\\nTherefore, recent antibiotic exposure explained differ-\\nences in antimicrobial resistance between the turkey and\\nbroiler populations and laying hens as for the ﬁve human\\npopulations tested. The prevalences and degrees of anti-\\nbiotic resistance for nearly all antibiotics tested were sig-\\nniﬁcantly higher in the turkey and broiler populations,\\ncompared with laying hens and also for resistance in single\\nisolates. In these isolates resistance to ﬁve or more anti-\\nbiotics occurred commonly in turkey and broiler isolates\\nand not in laying-hen isolates. These differences clearly\\nreﬂected more recent antibiotic usage in broilers and\\nturkeys.\\nSimilarly, a higher prevalence of resistance was found\\namong faecal samples and single isolates from both turkey\\nand broiler farmers and slaughterers compared with those\\nfrom laying-hen farmers. Moreover, the same resistance\\npatterns were found in turkeys, turkey farmers and slaugh-\\nterers and in broilers, broiler farmers and broiler slaughter-\\ners. Dissemination of resistant bacteria and/or resistance\\nplasmids from turkeys and broilers to their respective farm-\\ners is the most likely explanation for the high antimicrobial\\nresistance observed in the faecal E. coli of the farmers and\\n768\\nFigure.

None of the\\nturkey farmers and slaughterers and four broiler farmers\\nand slaughterers had used antibiotics in the 3 months pre-\\nceding sample collection. Neomycin resistance (prevalence\\nand level) was very high in the broiler slaughterers com-\\npared with other human populations. As neomycin resist-\\nance was higher in turkeys than in broilers it is unlikely that\\nthe high prevalence in broiler slaughterers was caused by\\ndirect contact with poultry meat products. The same phe-\\nnomenon has been observed in a previous study in pig\\nslaughterers:45 the common use of neomycin-containing\\nointments for treatment of minor occupational cuts and\\nskin lesions had most likely generated resistance. How-\\never, no information about the use of ointments could be\\nobtained from the two abattoirs in the present study.\\nA striking observation was the difference in resistance to\\nciproﬂoxacin—respectively 45 and 50% for turkey and\\nbroiler isolates, 25 and 8% for their respective farmers and\\n7% for broiler slaughterers. These relatively high percent-\\nages especially among the animal isolates were very prob-\\nably due to the therapeutic use of ﬂuoroquinolones in\\npoultry. The use of ﬂumequine and enroﬂoxacin accounts\\nfor 14% of all antibiotic use in poultry, especially in turkeys\\nand broilers.46 Enroﬂoxacin is a methylester of cipro-\\nﬂoxacin and both agents are completely cross-resistant.\\nFlumequine, the ﬁrst ﬂuoroquinolone developed, selects\\nfor low-level resistance to ciproﬂoxacin, as does nalidixic\\nacid.47,48 In The Netherlands, approximately 10% of clin-\\nical E. coli poultry isolates are resistant to ciproﬂoxacin and\\n35% to ﬂumequine. This low resistance rate is consistent\\nwith the absence of ciproﬂoxacin resistance in single iso-\\nlates of E. coli and a low degree of resistance. In The\\nNetherlands, ﬂuoroquinolone use in humans is low and\\nresistance in faecal E. coli in the general population is\\nextremely unusual.37,39,45 Similarly, because no formulation\\nfor mass medication of pigs is available in The Netherlands,\\nenroﬂoxacin use in pigs is unusual and the prevalence of\\nresistance in pig faecal E. coli is low (approximately 2%; in\\npig farmers 1% and in pig slaughterers \\x071%).36,46,49\\nAs resistance to ﬂuoroquinolones occurs by chromo-\\nsomal mutations, large populations of bacteria probably\\ncontain small numbers of spontaneously resistant mutants,\\nwhich may then undergo clonal expansion under the selec-\\ntive pressure of ﬂuoroquinolone use. This will initially\\noccur only within the population, but as the numbers of\\nresistant bacteria within that population (degree of resist-\\nance) increase, the chance of spilling over to other popula-\\ntions becomes greater, as has probably occurred in the\\nDutch poultry and poultry farmer populations. A similar\\ncourse of events has been described in Spain, where the\\nincreased use of ﬂuoroquinolones for therapy in humans\\nwas followed by an increase (up to 18%) in resistant E. coli\\nfrom urinary tract infections.50,51 Prior exposure of a\\npatient to a ﬂuoroquinolone was the single most important\\nrisk factor for a ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant E. coli infection.\\nAnalysis of ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant E. coli in the intest-\\ninal tract of healthy persons showed a prevalence of 24% in\\nadults and of 26% in children. Carriage in the healthy popu-\\nlation did not correlate with previous quinolone use; a\\nstrong argument for the pre-existence of resistant strains \\nin the community. As the prevalence of ﬂuoroquinolone\\nresistance in faecal E. coli from Spanish chickens and pigs is\\nvery high, 90 and 45%, respectively, it was postulated \\nthat food animals were the primary reservoir of ﬂuoro-\\nquinolone resistance in humans. Additionally, human ﬂuoro-\\nquinolone use might have caused further selection in the\\nintestinal tract and secondary dissemination in the human\\npopulation. However, resistant isolates were not geno-\\ntyped and clonal transmission could not be proved.51\\nIn this study PFGE of ciproﬂoxacin-resistant isolates\\nfrom turkey and turkey farmers, and broiler and broiler\\nfarmers showed a variety of patterns; in a turkey farmer\\nand his turkeys and a broiler farmer and a broiler, identical\\npatterns were observed, which proved that identical clones\\nwere present in humans and in poultry. Moreover, the\\nciproﬂoxacin-resistant E. coli isolates from the turkey wing\\ntips showed patterns similar to those from turkey farmers.\\nBecause of the low sensitivity of the method used, only one\\nE. coli was tested from each sample that grew E. coli in the\\nciproﬂoxacin-containing agar plates; one might expect that\\nclonal transmission of resistant bacteria from humans to\\nanimals is more common. The results in this study strongly\\nsuggest a spread of antibiotic-resistant E. coli from animals\\nto people—not only to farmers but also at a lower level to\\nthe consumers of poultry meats, and hence the low inci-\\ndence of ﬂuoroquinolone-resistant E. coli in the Dutch\\nhuman population. Further increase in ﬂuoroquinolone use\\nin human primary care medicine will be followed by clonal\\nspread of resistant commensal bacteria and an increase in\\nﬂuoroquinolone-resistant E. coli pathogens, as docu-\\nmented for E. coli isolates from urinary tract infections.52\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis study has been made possible by a grant from the\\nDutch Prevention Fund (no. 28-2075-1).\\nReferences\\n1.

Introduction\\nPoultry chickens are a major contributor towards the fulﬁllment of the demand for\\nhigh-protein and low-fat food around the world. The poultry industry has been fulﬁlling\\nthe demands of the chickens’ meat and their eggs for the last hundreds of decades [1]. The\\nincrease in the demand for chicken poultry has also raised the health quality of the chicken\\nas an important concern of the consumer market. The welfare of the animal is highly\\nconcerned towards the quality of the poultry products as well as the consumer’s health.\\nGood animal welfare always improves the health of the poultry products by reducing the\\ndisease rate within the poultry chickens and, hence, in the poultry products. The chickens\\nhave a tendency to spread illness within their respective ﬂocks and even to entire poultry\\nfarms, resulting in mass losses of the poultry industry [2].

The latest technologies provide a continuous and automated\\nmonitoring of the poultry chickens. These poultry monitoring techniques include sound\\nanalysis [3], which can automatically monitor the chicken’s behavior without direct inter-\\naction with the chicken’s body. The wearable sensing devices [4] help in the autonomous\\nidentiﬁcation and tracking of the chicken’s location and the movement of individuals in\\nthe real time with radio-frequency identiﬁcation devices. The surveillance of poultry farms\\nthrough image processing [5] is another technological advancement to identify the activity\\nbehaviors and early detection of the disease. All the technological advancements may track\\nand monitor the groups of poultry chickens or individuals.\\nThe recent advancement in wearable sensing devices for poultry farms collects the\\nchicken’s activity data [6] using accelerometers. Figure 1 provides the graphical representa-\\ntion of monitoring and tracking the poultry chickens by collecting their movement data.\\nThe activities observed include the dustbathing, pecking, and preening behaviors of the\\nchicken within poultry farms. Ectoparasites reside on the surface of the chicken’s body and\\ncan cause stress and affect the productivity of laying eggs and health of the chickens [7].\\nThe effect of ectoparasites on poultry chicken can infest the ﬂocks.

A GAN is an unsupervised learning in machine learning that\\ndiscovers and automatically learns the regularities or patterns of the provided dataset such\\nthat the model can generate the new data records that may be dropped or drawn from the\\nprovided dataset. The GAN frames the problem as a supervised learning problem with\\nfurther divisions: the training of the generator model to generate new data records and the\\ndiscriminator model to classify as original data records or as synthetic (generated) data\\nrecords. The training of these models continues until the discriminator model incorrectly\\nclassiﬁes more than 50% of its prediction. The deep generative models are used to provide\\nthe probability distribution of the dataset. It is a challenging problem to generate the\\nprobability distribution from a tabular dataset. Conditional Tabular Generative Adver-\\nsarial Networks (CTGAN) [8] have been implemented in the study to provide the deep\\ngenerative model to extrapolate the labeled dataset [6]. This tabular probability distributed\\ndataset will help in our study to predict the sick or healthy chicken using machine learning\\nclassiﬁcation techniques.'),\n",

Machine learning\\nmodels are diversiﬁed with the tendency to learn whether the data are statistical, proba-\\nbilistic, continuous, or discrete in nature. The machine learning supervised algorithms [9]\\nand deep learning models such as TabNet [10] are used to build predictive models with a\\ncapability to predict the resulting output more accurately. The classiﬁcation techniques are\\ncapable of predicting a diversiﬁed range of applications such as anomaly detection [11],\\nfraud detection [12], customer buying behavior [13], as well as disease modeling [14]. Most\\nof the applications of the machine learning classiﬁcation models adopt the supervised\\nlearning techniques rather than the unsupervised. In supervised learning, the input data\\nprovided to the classiﬁcation model are already labeled, and the model needs to predict\\nthe unlabeled dataset based on the similarities of the classiﬁcation class [15]. The machine\\nlearning classiﬁcation techniques are used to provide predictive models that can provide\\nthe labeling of the dataset in a more accurate way. The IoT-based predictive classiﬁcation\\nservices help in identifying the behavior of the receiving data such as the poultry chickens’\\nsickness or well-being. The supervised learning algorithms such as Nearest Neighbour,\\nDecision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine are applied in\\nthis study to classify the poultry chicken using an IoT-based predictive service.\\nOur contributions are more focused on modeling an IoT-based predictive service that\\nhelps the poultry industry in early detection of sick chickens more accurately in a real-time\\nmanner. The proposed study achieves the following:\\n—\\nImplements the CTGAN [8] deep generative model to overcome the class imbalance\\nproblem. Moreover, the dataset available by [6] is not enough to train machine learning\\nand deep learning models to classify sick and healthy poultry chickens;\\n—\\nImplements the supervised machine learning algorithms such as Nearest Neighbour,\\nDecision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and deep\\nlearning techniques such as TabNet [10] on the chickens’ synthetic movement data\\ngenerated using CTGAN [8] to classify the poultry chicken with better accuracy;\\n—\\nProvides a performance comparison of some machine learning and deep learning\\nmodels to classify the poultry chickens;\\n—\\nProvides an IoT-based predictive service framework to develop a precision livestock\\nfarming system which has the capability to track, monitor, detect, and predict the\\ndisease in poultry chicken at an early stage. It can accomplished by using wearable\\nsensor devices.\\nThe study further discusses the related advancements in Section 2 that provides\\nthe monitoring and predictive methods to determine the health of the poultry chickens.\\nSection 3 explains the dataset generation technique and the experimental setup that are\\nconducted in the study. Section 4 discusses the results obtained, followed by the conclusion.\\n2. Related Work\\nThe demand for poultry products raises the need for the implementation of the\\npoultry’s welfare. Healthy poultry products heavily depend on the good poultry conditions.\\nSeveral criteria for the comprehensive assessment of the poultry welfare contradict each\\nother and hence make the evaluation difﬁcult as well as time consuming. The technological\\nadvancements help poultry farmers to implement good poultry welfare by implementing\\none of the monitoring and tracking systems to observe the sickness or well-being of the\\npoultry chickens. The location of feeders and drinkers can be examined and changed\\nwith the presence of clusters or groups of the poultry chickens [16]. The activity such\\nas moving, perching, eating, and drinking may help in understanding the health of the\\npoultry chicken [17,18]. The key essence of the monitoring and tracking system is the\\nearly detection of the individual animals in livestock farming. The detection of chicken\\nmovement activities using wearable sensing devices can classify the chicken as sick, normal,\\nor active in the poultry farm [4].

The sound (noise) analysis has been carried out to detect avian inﬂuenza in poultry\\nchickens [3]. The extracted sound data are trained for the binary classiﬁcation model using\\nSupport Vector Machine.\\n2.2. Image Processing\\nImage processing provides an inexpensive and cost-effective autonomous analysis of\\nthe poultry behavior that includes the detection of health conditions, weight prediction,\\nand tracking and monitoring. The chickens’ activities in the ﬂock can also be recorded\\nand analyzed later for identifying different patterns and behaviors. Image processing\\nprovides an inexpensive and cost-effective autonomous analysis of the poultry behavior\\nthat includes the detection of health conditions, weight prediction, and tracking and\\nmonitoring. The chickens’ activities in the ﬂock can also be recorded and analyzed later\\nfor identifying different patterns and behaviors. The monitoring of ﬂock activity can\\nbe achieved by comparing the adjacent set of different pixels [16,26]. The detection of\\nabnormal feeding activity within the ﬂock can be treated as an early health warning\\nof the poultry chickens [16]. The monitoring of the poultry chicken behavior and the\\nearly detection of infection can be accomplished by analyzing the feces of the poultry\\nchickens [17]. The image processing techniques were applied to clean the dataset to perform\\nthe data analysis. The study proposed that its monitoring and classiﬁcation mechanism to\\nidentify the Campylobacter-free chicken ﬂocks is much better than conventional on-farm\\nmicrobiological methods. The study claims to provide the monitoring results within 7 to\\n10 days. The implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed on a\\ncomputer vision system for the crowd monitoring of poultry chickens around feeders with\\nan accuracy of 99.17% [27].\\nThe crowd observed around the feeder is categorized as not crowded, low crowded,\\nand fairly crowded. The number of poultry chickens has been calculated using an IR\\ncamera in a controlled lighting environment [28]. The image colors were cropped and\\nconverted into grey-scale and then further converted into binary images. The number of\\npoultry chickens were counted as white pixels with an accuracy of 71.23%. The disease\\nprediction and classiﬁcation is achieved with posture features modeling through an SVM\\nModel with an accuracy of 99.47% [5].\\nThe weight of the poultry chicken is predicted using the computer vision techniques\\nthrough an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) [29]. The maximum error of the weight\\npredicted was less than 50 g when weighed individually. The thermal camera is proposed\\nto manage the heat stress within the poultry chickens [30]. The prediction of the chickens’\\nhealth was performed by applying the Support Vector Machine classiﬁcation model over\\nthe temperature dataset collected. The temperature dataset of the chickens was collected\\nby using thermal cameras within the control environment in the poultry farms. The study\\nclaims that climate changes, including temperature and humidity, play an important role\\nin the reduced feed intake, growth, weight, semen, and fertility of the chickens.\\nThe thermal camera is also used for the video surveillance to label the data and\\ndepth camera to model the chicken’s health [31]. The mobility features (walk speed) were\\nextracted and statistical analysis was carried out for the feature investigations. The study\\nclaims that the earliest infection detection time possible by the authors is on the forth day\\nbased on the elongation and variance of the circle.\\n2.3.

Through the RFID mechanism, the location of the poultry\\nchickens can be obtained, and hence, the entire movement of the poultry chicken within\\nthe ﬂock can be observed. The integration of the Internet of Things design along with the\\nwearable sensing devices help in observing the poultry chickens’ movement in a real time.\\nAn RFID reader is placed in a poultry nest, and the RFID tags were placed over the poultry\\nchickens in order to observe the frequency of the chickens going in or out of the nest [33].\\nThe solution is also enhanced by adding the egg detection sensor to observe the egg laying\\nbehavior and can ﬁnd the abnormalities as early warnings.\\nThe behavior of the poultry chickens laying eggs can also provide an analysis of the\\nrelationship between keel bone fractures and laying eggs [34].

The study also classiﬁed the poultry chickens as\\nactive, normal, or sick using the K-means clustering method. The feeding and nesting\\nbehavior can also be observed using the RFID microchips [35].

This helps them in addressing\\nthe transmission and processing issues of big data over the cloud.

Introduction\\nThere is a worldwide movement to support a sustainable agricultural system that involves\\nsustaining farmers, resources, and societies. It is expected that this can be achieved by upgrading\\nfarming practices that are proﬁtable, environmentally sound, good for communities, and antibiotic-free.\\nHowever, raising animals without antibiotics is a challenge, and especially, antibiotic-free broiler\\nmeat production is a growing challenge in many developing countries, including Bangladesh,\\nwhere antibiotics are used injudiciously [1]. Broiler chickens are reared particularly for meat production\\nbecause of their typical soft, tender meat, low-fat content, and short production period. Broilers take\\nthe place of valuable food animals globally by notably contributing to food security, protein supply,\\nand people’s employment [2]. Sustainable broiler production not only requires maximum productivity\\nbut, also, includes bird and human welfare and environmental protection. In addition, consumers\\nare concerned about antibiotic residue and antimicrobial resistance, as well as pesticide residues,\\nadditives, nutritional content, ﬂavor, traceability, regional production, genetically modiﬁed organisms,\\nsocial justice, etc., with regards to broiler meat production. Therefore, broiler meat production\\nwithout using antibiotics is crucial in the battle of antimicrobial resistance to save poultry, animals,\\nand public health.\\nBroiler meat production has undergone exponential growth for global consumption and\\nbusiness proﬁt. Low production costs and rapid economic progress are pivotal in its expansion [3].\\nThough commercial poultry farming is a proﬁtable business, it faces a number of challenges.\\nAmong them, the occurrence of infectious and noninfectious diseases is a major challenge due\\nto poor biosecurity and husbandry practices. Over several decades, some antibiotics have been used\\nin broiler feed to control, prevent, and treat diseases and boost performance and feed eﬃcacy [4,5].\\nThis inappropriate antibacterial use favors antimicrobial resistance. The most common pathway\\nfor bacteria to gain resistance is through mobile genetic components, including bacteriophages,\\nplasmids, naked DNA, or transposons.\\nPlasmid-mediated gene transfer facilitates the ﬂow of\\nresistant genes between bacteria, accelerating antibiotic resistance [6]. Bacteria can also develop\\nantibiotic resistance through sequential mutations in the chromosome, as happens in ﬂuoroquinolone\\nresistance.\\nUsing normal genetic variations, bacterial populations mutate to render antibiotics\\nineﬀective against them [7]. Indeed, antibiotic resistance begins with the interaction between bacteria\\nand antibiotic, leading to the removal of sensitive bacteria and selection of resistant populations.\\nHowever, the distribution and assortment of resistance are complicated matters that pose a severe\\npublic health problem [8]. The indiscriminant use of antibiotics in nonbacterial infections like inﬂuenza\\nand other viral infections facilitates antibiotic resistance [9].\\nIn Bangladesh, commercial poultry farmers extensively utilize antibiotics without any veterinary\\nadvice and often do not follow withdrawal period guidelines [10]. A lack of both easily accessible\\nveterinary facilities and adequate knowledge combined with a high-proﬁt motive are some of the\\nfactors that drive local producers to inappropriate and, at times, illegal use of antimicrobial agents [11].\\nThe cost-eﬀective production of broilers may act as a driver for the practice of using growth-promoting\\nmedicines, including antibiotics, for the overall growth performance [12,13]. These agents get stored in\\nvarious body parts and tissues, resulting in antibiotic residues for unintended exposure to consumers.\\nSattar et al. [14] reported antibiotic residues mostly in the liver, kidney, thigh meat, and breast meat\\nof broilers. Easy access to antibiotics from registered veterinarians by farmers without prescriptions\\ncontributes to the indiscriminant use of antibiotics, which can result in antimicrobial resistance from\\nfood animals [11]. Although antibiotic resistance has always been present in nature, antibiotic pressure\\ndue to inappropriate use facilitated the rapid and widespread emergence of drug-resistant pathogenic'),\n",

As several antibiotics frequently consumed by livestock are identical to those used in\\nhumans, there is worldwide fear that antibiotic-resistant bacteria may be transferred from animals\\nto humans, leading to severe public health concerns [16]. Resistant bacteria with resistant genes can\\nquickly spread among humans, animals, and the ecological community. Therefore, new approaches\\nshould be considered for antibiotic-free broiler production so they can be sustainably raised and\\nmarketed. Therefore, this review highlights the current scenario of antibiotic use in broiler meat\\nproduction, as well as the global challenges, prospects, and approaches of antibiotic-free production,\\nparticularly in the context of Bangladesh.\\n2. Economic and Clinical Importance of Antibiotic-Free Broiler Meat Production\\nThe fast growth of the poultry industry has been attained through the eﬀective implementation\\nof high-yielding strains of meat-type chickens and the availability of nutritionally balanced feed.\\nBroiler farming plays a central role in enhancing income, improving food safety, and mitigating\\nscarcity in the countryside and in semi-urban communities in developing countries. For a couple of\\ndecades, the poultry industry has played a critical role in the economic development of Bangladesh by\\nproviding job opportunities, food security, and good-quality protein. The poultry industry has assisted\\nin changing living and food habits by moderating animal protein sources such as beef and mutton.\\nFor instance, about 44% of the protein for everyday human consumption comes from poultry and\\nanimal products [17]. As a primary portion of production, this industry’s ability to furnish the country\\nwith aﬀordable and nourishing protein in the form of meat and eggs is encouraging [18]. There are over\\na million small and large poultry farms, 80 grandparent (GP) stock farms, 130 parent stock farms and\\nhatcheries, and over 50 feed mills across the country, making up a USD 2.36 billion industry. About ﬁve\\nmillion people are employed in the industry directly and indirectly. A study estimated that around\\n150,000 poultry farms in Bangladesh are producing 570 million tons of meat and 7.334 billion eggs\\nannually, and about 68.17% of animal protein consumed comes from poultry meat [19]. A signiﬁcant\\nnumber of pastoral individuals depend on this business for their income. The poultry industry has\\nmade up one-third of the entire agronomic contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (18.60%)\\nin recent years [20].\\nIn food animal production, antibiotics are also exploited, albeit unwisely, to advance animal growth\\nand feed eﬃciency [21,22]. Generally, farmers in developing countries use antibiotics deliberately to\\npromote growth without any veterinary consultation. Additionally, shockingly, 88% of producers\\ndid not adhere to the required antibiotic withdrawal time before marketing [22]. On the other hand,\\nonly 10% of farmers stopped using antibiotics before marketing, and only 2% of farmers withdrew\\nantibiotics at least seven days before marketing. Still, they did not always follow this withdrawal\\nprotocol [23]. Generally, excessive and unnecessary use of medicines aﬀects the total cost of production.\\nA study on the antibiotic usage patterns in Bangladesh concluded that the use of antibiotics has an\\neconomic eﬀect on broiler production [11]. Another study revealed that the cost of antibiotic usage\\ncould be 3.53% of the overall production rate based on responses from 84% of farmers [23]. The cost\\nof antibiotics varies from farm to farm due to the presence and severity of diseases and their use as\\ngrowth promoters. Removing antibiotics from broilers can lower the production cost and, thereby,\\ndecrease the market price of broiler meat.\\nThe nontherapeutic use of antibiotics increases the residual accumulation more than medically\\nnecessary to use and, thereby, increases the incidence of antimicrobial resistance. The consumption of\\nresidual medicines through animal food products (e.g., meat, milk) is assumed to initiate resistance\\ndevelopment in humans. Besides, commensal bacteria of livestock are often present in fresh meat,\\nwhich can serve as reservoirs of resistant genes to be relocated to pathogenic bacteria in humans [7].\\nStudies have shown that antibiotic residues were present in more than 50% of samples of broiler and\\nlayer meat collected in diﬀerent regions of Bangladesh [14,22]. Another study by Faiz and Bashe\\n(2011) reported that some pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi,\\nare resistant to commonly used antibiotics [24]. The high degree of antibiotics resistance in Bangladesh'),\n",

In Bangladesh, diarrhea accounts for around 230,000 child\\ndeaths annually, and a signiﬁcant portion is due to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection [19].\\n3. Prospects of Antibiotic-Free Broiler Meat Production\\nIn veterinary practice, antibiotics are used for prophylactic, therapeutic, and growth-promoting\\npurposes. The purchase of medicines without a prescription is common in developing countries\\nlike Bangladesh. This can lead to an inadequate course of treatment, incorrect antibiotic selection,\\nindiscriminant and excessive use, and enhanced residual deposition in animal bodies. A recent study\\nwith 160 poultry samples from diﬀerent regions in Bangladesh identiﬁed antibiotics in more than\\n50% of the samples [22]. Producing a suﬃcient amount of food for a growing population is a great\\nchallenge for any country. Of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 14 are connected to\\nthe poultry sector in some way or other. According to data from the Bangladesh Poultry Industries\\nCentral Council (BPICC), the annual commercial production of eggs and poultry meat is about\\nto 1022 crore pieces and 14.6 lakh tons, respectively. Thus, the poultry industry appears to be a\\nbig sector, worth about USD 353.88 crore [26]. Nowadays, consumers are refusing to consume\\nantibiotic-treated chicken and demanding safe, antibiotic-free beef. Therefore, there is a large market\\nfor antibiotic-free chicken in Bangladesh. The challenge is to ﬁnd a way to produce them. One option\\nwould be to use medicinal plants instead of antibiotics as growth promoters. Bangladesh is rich in\\nmedicinal plants, and many such plants have been shown to have antibacterial activities, such as\\nAbutilon indicum L., Caesalpinia bonduc L., Ixora nigricans L., etc.\\nMany natural foods also have\\nantibacterial actions, such as broccoli (Brassica oleracea), guava (Psidium guajava), garlic (Allium sativum),\\nand okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) [27–30]. Based on antibacterial medicinal plants and natural foods,\\na safe antibacterial preparation could be developed to use in food animals as an alternative to antibiotics\\nfor growth promotion and feeding eﬃciency.\\n4. Signiﬁcant Challenges for Sustainable Antibiotic-Free Broilers Production\\nBangladesh is a developing country, and its seasonal variations are very distinct, categorized\\nby extreme temperatures, excessive humidity, and heavy rainfall. The environment is beneﬁcial\\nfor the survival and growth of various microorganisms and makes them ubiquitous and fastidious.\\nMost poultry farmers are not well-educated or well-trained for modern scientiﬁc farming. It is\\nestimated that about 80% of farmers lack adequate knowledge about rearing current high-yielding\\nstrains [23]. Moreover, farmers in Bangladesh can quickly get antibiotics from local vendors without a\\nveterinarian’s prescription. Biosecurity measures are also terrible; thus, the entry of microorganisms on\\nmost farms is common, aﬀecting the production performance of ﬂocks. The commercial livestock sector\\nis multiplying and conveying a lot of diseases with it. Thus, biosecurity must be implemented without\\nfail [26]. Newcastle disease, Gumboro or infectious bursal disease, Marek’s disease, duck plague,\\nfowl pox, fowl cholera, leucosis, and infectious bronchitis are among the most common infectious\\ndiseases in the poultry sector [26]. It is therefore essential to control primary and secondary infections\\nfor successful poultry farming in Bangladesh. One of the most critical factors in antibiotic-free broiler\\nproduction is the economic challenge, i.e., cost management. The most critical challenges in producing\\nantibiotic-free broilers in Bangladesh and abroad (Figure 1) are addressed below.'),\n",

Schematic presentation of the challenges in sustainable antibiotic-free broiler production.\\n4.1. Environment\\nWhatever system is followed in any corner of the world, none can deny that environmental\\npollution is a part of broiler production. Disease and mortality are likely to increase due to polluted\\nand hazardous environments. Increased clinical and subclinical necrotic enteritis (NE) and related\\ndisorders, including cholangiohepatitis, on poultry farms are the likely consequences. Therefore,\\nit is vital to keep the level of pollution to a minimum for the well-being of both birds and humans.\\nTo achieve this goal, farmers should prioritize proper carcass disposal and waste management during\\nfarm operations. While about 70% of all agricultural land globally is occupied by livestock [31],\\npoultry farming’s eﬀect on agricultural land loss is minimal [32]. However, another study suggested\\nthat feed production, processing, and transport result in a greater overall environmental impact\\nthan any other part of broiler production [33,34]. Therefore, farmers must follow the principles of\\npoultry production, upholding public interest, as well as a hazard-free environment, thereby ensuring\\nsustainable antibiotic-free poultry meat production.\\n4.2. Resource Management\\nResource management is the process by which farm owners eﬀectively utilize their tangible\\nand intangible resources.\\nIt involves eﬀective planning to ensure that the right resources are\\nassigned to the right tasks. Broiler meat production without the use of antibiotics requires farmers to\\ndecrease the stocking density, raise the downtime, clean rapidly and frequently, maintain the correct\\ntemperature, provide rigorous biosecurity, reduce hassle, select the best breed, etc. Therefore, it is a\\nsigniﬁcant undertaking for the eﬃcient utilization of limited resources in broiler farming management.\\nBroiler production and meat processing require an adequate supply of water. Thus, inadequate\\nwater availability is a signiﬁcant obstacle to sustainable antibiotic-free broiler meat production [35].\\nAnother relevant aspect of resource management is feeding the poultry. There is competition between\\npoultry and humans for quality proteins. This creates a challenge when a protein-rich foodstuﬀ(wheat\\nand maize) needs to be included in the supplied ration [36,37].\\n4.3. Antibiotics\\nDespite increasing concerns, antibiotics are used worldwide on poultry farms, particularly broiler\\nfarms, to treat and prevent diseases and as growth promoters to improve meat production [38–40].\\nAntibiotics are commonly used to treat intestinal infections caused by Salmonella, Escherichia coli (E. coli),\\nor Clostridium spp. These pathogens can negatively impact poultry farming and farmers’ proﬁt.

Although the monitoring of antibiotic use\\nis essential, it is poorly implemented around the world, including in Bangladesh [40]. According to\\na recent estimate, the average annual global consumption of antimicrobials per kilogram of chicken\\nproduction was 148 mg [42]. Furthermore, a rise of the antimicrobial consumption by 67% was\\nprojected [42]. The widespread use of antibiotics on broiler farms could encourage antibiotic resistance,\\nultimately causing a global public health threat [43]. Alternative approaches should be investigated\\nto replace growth-promoting antibiotics to maintain and ensure gut health and good-quality meat\\nproduction. However, producing quality broiler meat at consumer-friendly prices without antibiotics\\nwill be a challenge.\\n4.4. Breed Diversity\\nIn the modern period, it is evident that there is minimal breed and genetic variability among\\ncommercial birds. Researchers have found that the breed or genetic diversity of commercial chicken\\nfarms has declined in the developed world. This is mainly because modern industrialized agriculture\\ndepends, in no small degree, on uniformity.\\nThere are hundreds of breeds of poultry that are\\nwell-recognized and registered. Most of these poultry breeds and varieties are locally adapted for\\nmultiple purposes and suited to various farming enterprises. They are mostly reared under small-hold\\nproduction systems and are a large part of poultry meat production worldwide. On the contrary,\\nmodern chicken strains are raised for either meat or eggs, and only limited high-producer strains are\\nemployed. However, such top-yielding hybrids are more susceptible because of their compromised\\nimmune capacity [44]. Not cultivating other breeds means not only sacriﬁcing the natural genetic\\ndiversity but, also, decreasing the birds’ potential to adapt to new conditions and circumstances,\\nsuch as climate changes [45]. It is noteworthy that genetic uniformity or a lack of genetic diversity\\nmakes birds more vulnerable to many diseases. While it is convenient and proﬁtable to mass-produce\\na particular breed, the loss of diversity makes it more challenging to adapt to changes [46].\\n4.5. Social Aspects\\nTwo social issues, working environments and human health, and the impartiality of job agreements,\\nincluding health care, fair wages, and cooperative trading rights, are signiﬁcant matters in sustainable\\nbroiler production. Poultry farmers and their family members risk becoming contaminated with\\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria and developing antibiotic allergies. Health ailments in farm workers due\\nto exposure to dust, litter, and feathers are quite common [47] and should receive attention to assure\\nproduction continuity. According to Quandt et al. [48], “chicken grabbing” in the USA is characterized\\nby a working atmosphere and work organization that encourages accidents and illness and is closely\\nconnected to the risk of disease, human rights, and overall working environments. Workers are\\nexploited disproportionately in food-producing industries such as the poultry sector. For example,\\nhealthy working conditions are not maintained in order to keep the direct costs of production low.\\nBesides, the terms and conditions with contract growers vary greatly and, in some cases, are grossly\\nunreasonable [49,50].\\n4.6. Gender Issue\\nAmong the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015,\\npromoting gender egalitarianism and empowering women is noteworthy.\\nCommercial poultry\\nproduction on an industrial scale does not ﬁrmly follow this gender goal. However, small-scale family\\npoultry production with low input is mostly run by women in most Asian and African countries. Such a\\nproduction system supplies much-needed poultry meat and eggs for the proper nutrition of millions of\\npeople worldwide and helps reduce poverty and improve incomes in rural areas. Dolberg et al. [51]'),\n",

While women are often responsible for taking care of poultry, they usually face\\nmore critical challenges than men. Women have less access to and inﬂuence over property, credit,\\nlabor, technology, and the facilities required to take advantage of development opportunities. In some\\ninstances, they do not have full control or decision-making authority over the birds or the revenue\\nfrom their sale [52]. Further, the keeping of family poultry (FP) is typically the responsibility of women.\\nUnfortunately, there is a lack of knowledge of women’s and men’s particular roles in FP production;\\nthis results in gender blindness. Therefore, the contribution of women to this subsector of poultry\\nremains invisible [53]. Thus, the gender issue is a massive challenge in sustainable antibiotic-free\\nbroiler meat production in Bangladesh.\\n4.7. Animal Welfare\\nIt is imperative that we look after the welfare of animals that serve us in so many ways. Humanity\\ndemands it. With the advancement of time, the animal welfare issue has become a matter of great\\nconcern. The suﬀering of poultry caused intentionally or unintentionally cannot be justiﬁed in any\\nproduction [54]. The Animal Welfare Standards research project funded by the EU laid down 12\\nstandards for animal protection. For example, poultry should not be stressed from excessive hunger or\\nthirst, should have room for free movement, and should show usual nonharmful behavior. Poultry\\nproducers should promote positive emotions and avoid negative emotions, such as fear, distress,\\nfrustration, and apathy. These criteria are currently not fulﬁlled by many producers, and some poultry\\nproduction systems may cause suﬀering [55]. Skipping a day of feeding broiler breeders to control their\\nbody weight aﬀects the chickens’ welfare under the modern husbandry system. This practice needs\\nthe attention of researchers to ensure the sustainability of production in the future. It is interesting to\\nnote that some studies recommend providing low-density feeds to increase female broiler breeders\\nas an alternative to feeding constraints [56]. Any improvement in animal welfare also upgrades the\\nsustainability and is less harmful to the environment. Nevertheless, it is challenging to balance the\\nrelationship between poultry production, animal welfare, and the impact of production on the ground.\\nOrganic animal production is often set in with sustainability, which can lead consumers to think that\\nanimals raised organically have better welfare. Although some organic poultry systems uphold high\\nlevels of interest, it can be challenging to maintain good health and well-being on organic poultry\\nfarms [57].\\n4.8. Institutional Aspects\\nThe institutional dimensions of sustainability comprise the management and governance of global\\nprocesses and ensure that organizations are responsible, accountable, and transparent to their members\\nand representatives. Indeed, a few breeding corporations dominate a signiﬁcant part of the industry,\\nmaking it hard for small businesses to start up. The producer should balance the multiple interests\\ninherent in the principle of sustainability with the management of operations. Although Bangladesh’s\\ngovernment has many policies to meet the SDGs to tackle the economic, environmental, and social\\naspects, there is still no poultry policy to coordinate with other enterprises. One policy in a ﬁeld\\noften hampers advancement in another. Solutions to diﬃcult problems are sometimes in the hands of\\npolicymakers in diﬀerent industries or at various government levels. It is a signiﬁcant cause of many\\nunsustainable long-term patterns [46]. The sustainability of poultry production involves producing\\nsuﬃcient outputs to provide satisfactory products for consumers and income for farmers and constant\\navailability of the required inputs such as raw materials, labor, and capital in the long term. On a\\nbiological basis, the production of village-based poultry in Bangladesh is almost sustainable. Almost all\\nof the necessary feed is found through scavenging, and home-grown grain and byproducts serve as\\nfeed supplements. Although poultry meat and egg productivity has increased continuously during\\nthe last decades, it is questionable whether the consequent rapidly rising need for poultry products\\nwill be fulﬁlled in the future.

In recent years, Bangladesh’s action plan to train vast numbers of\\nrural extension staﬀand coordinate the supply of vaccines at the rural level has been useful. There is\\nalso a need to ensure the long-term viability of the organizational structure and training programs.\\n4.9. Consumption Pattern and Demand for Poultry Products\\nThe requirements for poultry products will be doubled in 2050 based on the rising usage in recent\\ndecades [49]. It is believed that today’s food insecurity problems are not due to a shortage of food but,\\nrather, to poor people’s ability to aﬀord it. Increasing consumption patterns in some countries will\\ndemand increased production. In contrast, as people grow wealthier, the demand for healthier “green”\\ndiets or organic foods will increase in some other countries [46]. On the other hand, the indiscriminate\\nuse of antibiotics or other harmful substances in the production chain negatively aﬀects consumers’ trust\\nin broiler meat. These results negatively impact market demand, as observed recently in Bangladesh.\\nA lack of conﬁdence in the product threatens sustainable production, causing colossal loss to the\\nindustry. Farmers must balance order, supply, and consumption patterns in a transparent and healthy\\ncompetitive environment. Further, the quality of feeds and feeding programs is also a component of\\nsustainable broiler production. The purpose of a feeding program is to feed the chickens and not the\\nbacteria. A successful feeding program is essential in antibiotic-free broiler production. Poor-quality\\nfeed ingredients, rancid animal byproducts in the feed, and mycotoxin contamination can damage gut\\nhealth and the intestinal epithelium. Therefore, excellent feed ingredients are essential to keep proper\\ngut health, as well as better ﬂock health. However, these ingredients will increase the production cost\\nunless the savings from not using antibiotics can oﬀset the cost of quality feed. This is an important\\nconsideration, since consumers in Bangladesh are demanding high-quality products but are unwilling\\nto pay more. Therefore, it may be a signiﬁcant challenge to supply antibiotic-free broiler meat at a\\nprice desired by consumers.\\n5.

Strict Downtime between Placements\\nIt is a quick, simple management procedure to raise antibiotic-free broilers. In this case, new\\nﬂock entry should be restricted to a minimum of 14 days (downtime) with good cleanout (clearing\\nout birds and removing the litter cake). The downtime should start when birds are out of the house\\nproduction site.\\n5.2. Optimum Stocking Density\\nThe stocking density is a crucial concern for proﬁtable broiler farming. As the stocking density\\nincreases, so does the stress level of birds. Increased stress is associated with compromised immunity\\nand, consequently, an increased susceptibility to disease. Thus, decreasing stress by increasing the\\nstock density can help reduce the risk of disease and the need for antibiotics. A reduced stocking\\ndensity is also an excellent option to help keep litter moisture at a minimum compared to the current\\nconventional program. Farmers should decrease the stocking density, which, in turn, reduces the\\nshedding of cocci oocyst and pathogenic bacteria. This practice also helps in proper ventilation and\\naeration and, thus, reduces stress. However, the ideal stock density is still being debated. Bilgili and\\nHess [59] reported a signiﬁcant improvement of the overall growth performance, carcass quality,\\nand mortality with a decreased stock density. In Bangladesh, usually 1- to 1.5-square-feet of ﬂoor space\\nis assigned to each bird. However, in antibiotic-free broiler production, providing more space than\\nrequired is an important factor.'),\n",

Good Litter Management\\nKeeping the litter dry is critical in the overall management of any poultry farm, as it inﬂuences the\\nbird performance by decreasing the ammonia level and, thereby, the growers’ proﬁts. Dry waste and\\nlow ammonia levels are the keys to success in raising poultry. The negative impact of ammonia on bird\\nperformance is well-documented [60,61]. Dry litter controls the ammonia levels and provides a better\\nﬂock atmosphere and reduces disapproval due to contact dermatitis and inﬂamed bursa. When unused\\nbedding materials start to hold moisture, it will clump together to form caking, leading to increased\\nammonia formation. Caking is mainly due to moisture in the litter and can be prevented by having\\nadequate ventilation. Broilers drink approximately two pounds of water for every pound of feed\\nthey consume. About 20% of the water is used for growth, while most of it eventually reaches the\\nlitter as waste. Therefore, there must be adequate ventilation to remove moisture within the waste\\nto prevent caking. Generally overventilation is needed to ﬁx the problem once caking has started.\\nGrowers should attend to litter sanitation and treatment at regular intervals. It is a great idea to monitor\\nthe ammonia levels regularly, and handheld sensors can accurately manage them. Amending the litter\\nand providing adequate ventilation are the most practical ways to control ammonia and improve litter\\nquality [62]. Preventive fan maintenance can aid in keeping the ventilation program eﬀective. A total\\nlitter cleanout at least once a year is highly recommended.\\n5.4. Control Environment Housing\\nProducers can reduce bacterial growth and antibiotic use by maintaining the adequate ventilation\\nof poultry housing facilities. A study reported the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the air of\\nbroiler chicken facilities [63]. Dust is an excellent carrier of bacteria, while mold is a potential source\\nof infection. For appropriate airing, heat, relative moisture, and light, an environmentally controlled\\nstructure should be built oriented in the east-to-west direction longitudinally, with large exhaust\\nfans on the west side and evaporative chilling plugs on the east side, accompanied by programmed\\nfeeding and drinking methods inside [64]. Chick suppliers can provide useful information on the ideal\\ntemperature, humidity, and air quality for raising broilers. Airborne dispersion of antibiotic-resistant\\nbacteria should not be underestimated, considering the respiratory health of chickens and poultry\\nworkers. Farmers should follow the standard guidelines for maintaining adequate ventilation [64].\\n5.5. Pre-Starter Feed\\nPre-starter feed is crucial in establishing good gut microbe populations. To achieve a balance in gut\\nmicrobiota for nutritional enhancement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, boost the immune development,\\nand facilitate nutrient absorption, it is useful to include probiotics, prebiotics, organic acids, short-\\nand medium-chain fatty acids, and phytogenic feed. The broiler industry has achieved noteworthy\\nadvances in productivity by prioritizing the hereditary selection, diet, and controlling procedures. The\\nnutrition for broilers is focused on the need to get to the market weight as quickly as possible. There is\\na growing interest in a speciﬁcally designed pre-starter feed for 10–14 days of broiler growth, since\\nthis represents more than 20% of the growth time [65]. A specialized formulation should ensure that\\nthe feed is easily digestible and meets the broiler’s nutritional needs. The eﬃcacy of pre-starter diets\\nrelies on the potential carryover eﬀect to increase the bird performance until market age. The nutrient\\nrequirements, particularly digestible amino acids, are crucial in the broiler’s ﬁrst 10 days. Rice and its\\nlower non-starch polysaccharide substance may be a better option than corn or wheat for pre-starter\\ndiets. Additionally, the addition of ﬁbrous components in low-ﬁber feeds at earlier stages may enhance\\nthe gut development and improve nutrient absorption, eventually enhancing the overall growth\\nperformance. Finally, the manufacturer should concentrate on feed formulations to remove antibiotic\\ngrowth promoters from all broiler diets. This will ensure sustainable growth and gain consumer\\nacceptance. Broiler feed should receive particular attention by providing the particle size, protein and\\nfat qualities, and speciﬁc additives.'),\n",

Water Quality and Sanitation\\nA good water sanitation program is key to healthy poultry production. Water is essential for birds.\\nA routine water quality analysis for bacteria, pH, hardness, minerals, and total dissolved solids should\\nbe conducted annually. Flushing and disinfecting between ﬂocks with suitable quality disinfectants\\nshould be done to remove bioﬁlm from the pipeline. Bioﬁlm is a sticky ﬁlm that can exist inside\\nwater lines, regulators, and nipple drinkers and can be composed of bacteria and other organisms [66].\\nChlorine is the most popular sanitizer; other well-documented sanitizers include hydrogen peroxide,\\nchlorine dioxide, and ozone. In addition, acidiﬁers can improve the sanitizer’s eﬀectiveness and reduce\\nbacterial growth in water lines [67].\\n5.7. Antibiotic Alternatives\\nOver the past two decades, producers have extensively used antibiotics for broiler weight\\ngain. Including antibiotics in broiler production enhances the food conversion ratio by 4% [68].\\nThus, measures need to be in place to oﬀset this loss and any undesirable growth performance\\nin immunocompromised broilers [68]. Additionally, withdrawing antibiotic feed additives could\\nraise necrotic enteritis in the ﬂocks. Although removing antibiotic feed additives from the diet\\nwould enhance the production cost, this increased cost can be recovered from the expected increase\\nin broiler meat prices [69].\\nIt should be noted that the eﬀect on broiler growth and weight\\nfrom the withdrawal of growth-promoting medicines may occur only after the ﬁrst year [70].\\nThus, the campaign for an alternative to antibiotics should focus on antimicrobial stewardship [71].\\nThese alternatives should provide a low mortality rate and an adequate level of yield while preserving\\nthe environment and consumer health. Much research has been conducted to explore natural agents\\nwith beneﬁcial eﬀects similar to growth-promoting antibiotics. In addition, several nontherapeutic\\nalternatives can be substituted for antibiotics. The most popular options are probiotics, prebiotics,\\nenzymes, organic acids, immunostimulants, bacteriocins, bacteriophages, phytogenic feed additives,\\nnanoparticles, and essential oils (Table 2), and these alternatives will be discussed in detail below.\\n5.7.1. Probiotics and Prebiotics\\nProbiotics are yeasts and live bacteria that confer beneﬁcial eﬀects on the health if administered in\\nadequate doses (WHO, 2001). Probiotics can replace antibiotics by changing the intestinal microbiome,\\nthereby producing some of the eﬀects of antibiotics. For example, feed supplementation with probiotics\\nimproves the feed eﬃciency and intestinal health and, ultimately, facilitates the faster growth of\\nbroilers by reducing the intestinal pH, altering the intestinal bacterial composition, and improving\\ndigestive activity [72,73]. Probiotics stimulate endogenous enzyme production, which reduces the\\nproduction of toxic substances and increases vitamins and/or antimicrobials such as bacteriocins [74].\\nIt has been reported that bacteriocins inhibit the production of toxins and the adhesion of pathogenic\\nmicrobes [75]. Probiotics decrease colonization by intestinal bacteria and, ultimately, stimulate the\\nimmune response [74]. The administration of Enterococcus faecium, Streptomyces spp., and Bacillus spp.\\nin chicken feed triggers antibacterial eﬀects on other pathogenic bacteria in the small intestine\\n(Figure 2) [76–78]. Broiler feed supplemented with B. subtilis increased the body weights by 4.4% [78].\\nThe H2S and NH3 concentrations in chicken excretions were also reduced after treating chickens\\nwith probiotics, leading to less odor. Probiotics increased the meat quality of poultry by aﬀecting the\\nfat and protein contents [74,79]. They are essential in improving the water-holding capacity, color,\\npH, oxidation stability, and the chemical composition of meat, such as the fatty acid content [79].\\nFeed supplemented with B. licheniformis improves the juiciness, ﬂavor, and color of broiler chicken\\nmeat [80], which is appreciated by consumers [81]. Probiotic supplementation also lessens parasitic\\ninfestation in chickens [73]. Probiotics exert coccidiostatic eﬀects on Eimeria tenella, maintain intestinal\\nhealth, and reduce the spread and risk of coccidiosis in broiler production systems [81].'),\n",

E. coli, Escherichia coli.\\nThe nondigestible components of feed that exert potential beneﬁcial eﬀects on the health are\\nknown as prebiotics. Most prebiotics are fermentation products consisting of oligosaccharides and\\nshort-chain polysaccharides [82]. Their fermentable properties stimulate the growth and activity of\\nbeneﬁcial bacteria in the ileum and cecum and contribute to a healthy intestinal tract and, ultimately,\\nincrease poultry productivity [83,84]. They are also considered as excellent alternatives to antibiotics.\\nPrebiotics alter cecal proteobacteria composition and increase broiler growth [85]. Products containing\\nhigh levels of mannose and mannoprotein in the feed tend to increase villus cell numbers in the\\nintestines [86] and are essential for improving intestinal health, thereby producing healthier poultry.\\nAdding 0.2% mannan oligosaccharides to the chicken diet improves the intestinal health more than\\nantibiotics by reducing harmful pathogenic bacteria and increasing potentially beneﬁcial bacteria [87].\\n5.7.2. Organic Acids\\nOrganic acids are conservation agents widely known for protecting feed from microbial spoilage\\nand improving the nutrient digestibility in poultry [88]. Organic acids include carboxylic acids\\nthat carry a hydroxyl group on the alpha-carbon, such as malic, lactic, and tartaric acids, and pure\\nmonocarboxylic acids, including acetic, formic, butyric, and propionic acids. Organic acids can inhibit\\nthe microbial growth by disrupting bacterial enzymatic reactions and decreasing the transport of acidic\\ncompounds by nonionic diﬀusion through the membrane [89]. It has been reported that adding organic\\nacids to feed may improve the growth, feed conversion rate, and feed utilization of broilers [90–92].\\nWhile drinking water is a risk factor for spreading campylobacter infection in broilers, Chaveerach et al.\\ndemonstrated that organic acid-treated drinking water can potentially prevent campylobacter infection\\nin broiler ﬂocks without any damage to gut epithelial cells [93]. Blends of formic and propionic acids\\nin drinking water for chickens can generate homogeneous and distinct populations in the intestinal\\nmicrobiota and increase Lactobacillus spp. colonization in the ileum [91], which can be a substitute\\nfor antibiotics used to reduce pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These changes\\nin the intestinal microbiota and increased Lactobacillus populations suggest that organic acids can\\nsubstitute for antibiotics such as bacitracin to reduce pathogenic bacteria in the GIT [91]. Additionally,\\norganic acids have the potential to inhibit E. coli infection [94], and a supplementation with 2% citric\\nacid can improve the gut health [95]. It has been reported that formic acid, an extensively studied'),\n",

Several organic acids may also play beneﬁcial roles in digestion. For example, when butyric\\nacid is used as a feed additive, it improves the digestibility of ileal proteins from poorly digestible\\nprotein sources [92]. Butyric acid, a saturated carboxylic acid, is produced in the cecum and colon by\\nfermenting carbohydrates such as dietary ﬁber and unabsorbed starch [97]. Moreover, butyric acid is a\\nreadily available energy source for intestinal epithelial cells and stimulates their multiplication and\\ndiﬀerentiation, thereby improving the feed eﬃciency and growth performance of chickens [82,92,98].\\n5.7.3. Amino Acids and Enzymes\\nBroiler feeds are supplemented with amino acids and enzymes to increase the feed conversion [81].\\nThese enzymes are produced by fermenting fungi and bacteria. Enzymes enhance the digestibility\\nof the feed by facilitating the degradation of proteins, phytates, and glucan. For example, it has\\nbeen reported that broiler diets of wheat and barley supplemented with endo-b-1-4-xylanases and\\nb-1-3, 1-4-glucanases can improve the digestibility of the feed [99]. Another study reported that\\na phytase enzyme improved daily weight gain by increasing the villus width and decreasing the\\ncrypt depth [95].\\nLysins are bacteriophage endolysins that could be an alternative therapeutic\\noption instead of antibiotics. Lysins are phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases that cause lysis of\\nbacteria by cleaving peptidoglycan when applied exogenously to Gram-positive bacteria [100,101].\\nThe antibacterial eﬃcacy of several lysins has been reported; for example, peptidases, amidases,\\nand lysozymes showed antimicrobial potential against C. perfringens in poultry [102].\\n5.7.4. Phytogenic Feed Additives\\nPhytogenic feed additives (PFAs), also known as phytobiotics or botanicals, are derived from\\nplants, herbs, and spices and can improve animal health. PFAs are reported to positively aﬀect growth\\nby improving the feed conversion ratio (FCR), boosting the immune system, and reducing stress.\\nSeveral recent studies also showed that phytogenic feed additives promoted broiler chicken growth\\nand could be used as an alternative to antibiotics [72,103–106]. Another study demonstrated that\\nincluding Lippia javanica in broiler feed at 5 g/kg enhanced the broilers’ daily gain and slaughter weight.\\nPhytogenic extracts of Lippia javanica leaf can stimulate glycolysis and increase energy production\\nutilization and, thus, growth [107]. They can also improve the fatty acid proﬁle of broiler chicken\\nmeat [107]. It has been reported that the use of garlic (5 g/kg) and black pepper powder (1 g/kg) in broiler\\nfeed could enhance broiler chickens’ weight gain and consumption index [108]. Thus, PFAs have the\\npotential to replace antibiotics in the poultry industry. On the other hand, there are also essential oils,\\nthe hydrophobic concentrated liquid of odoriferous and volatile aromatic compounds, which can be of\\nplant origin (natural) or synthetic. The crucial vital oils in broiler production are trans-cinnamaldehyde,\\nthymol, eugenol, and carvacrol. They interfere with the bacterial enzymatic system and modulate\\ninﬂammation and immune responses. They are excellent alternatives to growth-promoting antibiotics\\nsuch as Avilamycin for increasing chicken production [109–111]. Essential oils also have a signiﬁcant\\nrole in preventing and controlling necrotic enteritis in chickens [112]. Furthermore, it was reported that\\nsupplementing with essential oils such as oregano (Origanum genus) in broiler feed at 300–600 g/kg\\nincreased the average daily gain of broiler chickens [110]. Therefore, essential oils should be used as an\\nalternative to antibiotics in the poultry industry.\\n5.7.5. Nanoparticles as Feed Additives\\nNanoparticles (NPs) used as supplements in broiler chicken feed are favorable for optimizing\\nthe overall health and FCR. Some NPs have been used in poultry feed to decrease harmful bacteria\\nand stimulate beneﬁcial bacteria in the chicken microbiota [113]. The impact of NPs on birds has been\\nstudied worldwide to better understand the overall health and growth performance, immune response,\\nand antibacterial prospects [114]. Gangadoo et al. [114] noted that the most commonly used silver\\nnanoparticles in commercial chicken feed were shown to boost chickens’ microbiota. However,'),\n",

To avoid the toxic side eﬀects,\\nscientists have investigated other nanoparticles that can safely contribute to the positive impact on\\nhealth and productivity. A study showed that selenium NPs at concentrations ranging from 0.15 to\\n1.20 ppm could enhance broilers’ average daily gains [115]. Others showed that selenium NPs had a\\npositive inﬂuence on chicken bodies, with reduced toxicity achieved at low concentrations from 0.3 to\\n0.5 ppm [116–120]. Meanwhile, similar concentrations of copper NPs as a supplement in poultry feed\\ncould have positive or negative health consequences. For example, a concentration of 50 ppm of copper\\nat sizes 2–15 nm produced a decreased metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, and heat production\\nand resulted in reduced embryonic development [121], whereas others showed that including copper\\nNPs in poultry feed could boost breast and leg muscle growth, along with decreased mortality in\\nbroiler chicks [121]. Various other metals have been synthesized as NPs as supplements to poultry\\nfeed. For example, studies using metal NPs such as zinc oxide, zirconium dioxide, and platinum\\nshowed that they had a positive inﬂuence on the antibacterial activity against Salmonella spp. and\\nStaphylococcus aureus [122–124]. On the other hand, Zn-bearing zeolite clinoptilolite NPs were shown\\nto improve broilers’ growth and feed intake ratio [125]. In addition, NPs combined with extracts of\\nnatural antibacterial products, such as certain herbs and oils, could be utilized to upgrade the overall\\nperformance of broiler feed. For instance, a study using a turmeric extract in nanocapsules showed\\nimproved meat quality without aﬀecting broiler performance.'),\n",

However, more research is needed on the beneﬁts of using nanoparticles with\\npoultry feed as an alternative to antibiotics.\\n6. Research Gap, Status, and Future Trends\\nThe global poultry industry has dramatically expanded to meet the increasing need for animal\\nproteins for human consumption. The Food and Agriculture Organization projected that annual meat\\nproduction by 2050 will be 200 million tons due to the global need [127]. Therefore, there is an urgent\\nneed to ﬁnd strategies by conducting relevant research to improve the growth rate, feed eﬃciency,\\nand health status and reduce the pathogen burden to meet the increased demand. It is possible to\\nuse feed formulations to improve the FCR, resulting in lower feed requirements to attain market\\nweight. Feed additives such as vitamins and minerals are usually combined with typical diets to\\nsupport a rapid growth and favorable FCR. Recently, various nanoparticles have been added to feed to\\nimprove the overall health performance and FCR. More studies determining the inﬂuence of NPs on\\nthe intestinal microbiota of chickens would allow scientists to understand their role in the production\\nof beneﬁcial gut microbes and metabolites. Recent advances in sequencing technology could allow a\\nmuch-needed understanding of the interactions between NPs and intestinal bacteria. Further research\\nthat includes the toxicology, histology, and the residual eﬀects of NPs on broiler weight and egg\\nproduction is warranted before any wide adoption of NPs in feed could occur [128].\\nIn contrast, the global consumption of antimicrobials in food animal production is anticipated to\\nincrease by two-thirds by 2030 due to rises in production and the demand for animal products. [129]\\nAlthough most antibiotic use occurs in the agricultural sector, relatively little research has been done\\non how antibiotic use in food animals contributes to the overall problem of antibiotic resistance.\\nThere is a notable lack of quantitative monitoring data on antibiotic use in broilers in most large\\npoultry-producing countries [40]. An increase in the progression and spread of antibiotic resistance\\nhas become a signiﬁcant concern. Over the past few decades, no new major types of antibiotics have\\nbeen developed and almost all known antibiotics are increasingly losing their curative sensitivity\\nagainst pathogenic microorganisms. A single health approach that highlights the connections among\\nhumans, animals, and the environment is required to tackle antibiotic resistance in an integrated\\nmanner. This viewpoint entails a pledge of cooperation among professionals in several disciplines,\\nincluding physicians, veterinarians, food safety practitioners, and environmental health experts.\\n7. Conclusions\\nAntibiotic-free poultry meat production is an old issue in developed countries; however, it is at the\\nbeginning stage in Bangladesh. Although consumers are becoming more interested in antibiotic-free\\npoultry, it is not easy to produce quality antibiotic-free meat while maintaining animal welfare and\\nmaking farming proﬁtable. There is still a long way to go for sustainable antibiotic-free broiler\\nmeat production, particularly in developing countries like Bangladesh.\\nThe aspects related to\\nbroiler meat production and marketing should be ensured through improved management systems,\\nproper legislation, and implementation. It is diﬃcult to achieve sustainable production if there is any\\ninterruption of the supply chain, such as the supply of day-old chicks from hatcheries or feed from feed\\nmills, or other support. As such, producing sustainable broiler meat without antibiotics is an ongoing\\nchallenge for the food industry in Bangladesh. To overcome this challenge, good management practices,\\nincluding strict biosecurity measures, should be ascertained. Moreover, access to antibiotics without a\\nprescription by veterinarians should be strictly enforced. In addition, for ﬁghting against antimicrobial\\nresistance, awareness-building programs as recommended by the World Organisation for Animal\\nHealth (OIE) (https://oie-antimicrobial.com/) should be implemented for raising awareness among\\npoultry farm workers, marginal poultry farmers, and poultry consumers to highlight the dangers of\\nantibiotic resistance and the beneﬁts of consuming antibiotic-free poultry meat.

      "vironment, precision feeding systems, and poultry welfare. Barriers to\n",
      "implementation of the highlighted technologies are also summarized. 2.1. Environmental monitoring systems\n",
      "The environment of the poultry house is an important factor for\n",
      "production that can be monitored and optimized. Environmental inputs\n",
      "include temperature, air velocity, ventilation rate, litter quality, hu-\n",
      "midity and gas concentrations, including carbon dioxide and ammonia\n",
      "(Dallimore, 2017). An example of how PLF technologies can be used to\n",
      "monitor and control the poultry house environment is exempliﬁed by\n",
      "humidity regulation via ventilation rate changes mediated by relative\n",
      "humidity sensors, as relative humidity is one of the more important\n",
      "environmental aspects of a poultry house (Conley, 2012). Relative hu-\n",
      "midity levels can impact bird health; additionally, relative humidity\n",
      "levels are known to be correlated with concentrations of ammonia and\n",
      "carbon dioxide gas in poultry houses. When levels of these gases in-\n",
      "crease, a decrease in production and bird health can occur (David et al.,\n",
      "2015). Currently, several technologies for monitoring environmental\n",
      "variables are commercially available and implemented in poultry pro-\n",
      "duction systems; however, more advanced systems of environmental\n",
      "monitoring and control are being researched. Multi-sensor systems\n",
      "capable of tracking temperature, air velocity and diﬀerential pressure in\n",
      "broiler houses have been shown to eﬀectively assess barn ventilation\n",
      "system function (Bustamante et al., 2012). The impact of the poultry\n",
      "house environment on production is evident, and implementation of\n",
      "environmental sensor technology in poultry houses can aid producers in\n",
      "reaching desired levels of production. For example, a prediction model\n",
      "generated by Jackman et al. (2015) used temperature, relative\n",
      "humidity, carbon dioxide, and ammonia sensor inputs combined with\n",
      "bird weight data in order to predict broiler weight up to 72 h in ad-\n",
      "vance, with the accuracy of the model being described by the authors as\n",
      "good to excellent. In broiler chicken production, where meeting a target\n",
      "bird weight by a speciﬁc date is important, systems like this would\n",
      "allow for actions to be taken sooner by producers if bird weight is\n",
      "projected to be low. As more non-invasive surveillance technologies are\n",
      "developed and implemented in poultry houses, including those for\n",
      "health, welfare and feeding, there exists potential for more data to be\n",
      "incorporated into predictive production models, potentially enhancing\n",
      "their predictive capabilities. Some technical limitations of environmental sensors for poultry\n",
      "production exist. For example, in a study where multiple sensor nodes\n",
      "were used to measure carbon dioxide in a controlled chamber, in-\n",
      "dividual sensors demonstrated linear responses to increasing carbon\n",
      "dioxide concentrations; however, their individual performances dif-\n",
      "fered, leading to diﬀerences in absolute carbon dioxide levels measured\n",
      "(Calvet et al., 2014). Therefore, the researchers highlighted the need for\n",
      "regular sensor calibration.\n",
      "4479\n",
      "This is especially important even though\n",
      "carbon dioxide sensors are thought to be more robust compared to\n",
      "ammonia or relative humidity sensors. Additionally, traditional place-\n",
      "ment of environmental sensors in poultry houses on walls or in an\n",
      "elevated position may not reﬂect the true environmental conditions of\n",
      "the poultry house airspace. Placement of wireless temperature, relative\n",
      "humidity, ammonia and carbon dioxide sensors on the poultry house\n",
      "ﬂoor elevated to be within the airspace of birds has been tested ex-\n",
      "perimentally (Jackman et al., 2015). Systems of wireless environmental\n",
      "sensors have potential for use in commercial houses, however, Jackman\n",
      "et al., (2015) reported that in order to use environmental data for bird\n",
      "weight prediction, individual poultry houses will likely need series of\n",
      "experiments and optimization to generate a predictive weight model. Robotics are another potential technology that could be used to\n",
      "monitor and maintain the environment of poultry houses. Robots that\n",
      "can automate monitoring of the environment of poultry houses are\n",
      "currently being developed and produced by a number of commercial\n",
      "manufacturers (Connolly, 2017). Robots are designed as autonomously\n",
      "driven small vehicles that operate on the ﬂoor or lightweight devices\n",
      "that travel on rails above the birds, performing tasks as they navigate\n",
      "the poultry house. These robots could enhance bird health and activity\n",
      "levels by inducing bird movement (Epp, 2019). In addition, commer-\n",
      "cially available robots with added devices can aerate the litter on the\n",

      "fection in broilers has been experimentally observed in poultry rooms\n",
      "with aerated litter (Bodi et al., 2013). Robots that can apply disin-\n",
      "fectants to the litter are also currently being produced for use in poultry\n",
      "houses (Epp, 2019). Additionally, these newly developed robots can\n",
      "contain sensors that evaluate the environment of the poultry house in\n",
      "real-time (McDougal, 2018). Robots like this allow the environment to\n",
      "be monitored remotely, decreasing the need for human workers to enter\n",
      "the poultry house, thereby enhancing biosecurity. 2.2. Precision feeding systems\n",
      "Feeding on poultry farms is an important aspect of raising poultry\n",
      "and it is an area where PLF technologies can have a major impact on\n",
      "production. Whether it is maximum growth, achieving precise feed\n",

      "pecking have also been shown to be associated with a higher incidence\n",
      "of squawking and vocalization (Bright, 2008). Detecting infection with\n",
      "pathogenic microorganisms is also possible with this technology. The\n",

      "infection before clinical signs are evident in infected chickens (Carroll\n",

      "compared to conventional methods employed for disease detection such\n",

      "barriers to implementation of non-invasive technologies in the poultry\n",
      "industry, and research and development in these areas are required for\n",
      "their eventual use. For example, the presence of background noise in\n",

      "welfare, for example, one ﬂaw of broiler footpad imaging technology\n",

      "developed an assay that could detect the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of\n",
      "inﬂuenza virus. This sensor assay utilized a dual-probe system in which\n",

      "Big data refers to the collection and analysis of datasets described by\n",
      "volume, variety and velocity, and the resultant enhanced decision\n",
      "making abilities that result (Sicular, 2013). Detailed review of big data\n",

      "tions, such as for genetics and breeding, the uses for big data in the\n",
      "poultry industry have remained largely underexplored, but possibilities\n",
      "for its applications are exciting and are an important tool that will help\n",

      "to reach the scale of production required for the future.\n",
      "57\n",
      "According to\n",
      "Wolfert et al. (2017), in order to make use of data for smart farming,\n",
      "data must be extracted from diﬀerent sources and integrated into a\n",
      "platform that allows for analysis. Initial data preprocessing will be\n",
      "important for poultry operations, as it will decrease the data that must\n",
      "be stored, thereby increasing storage eﬃciency and improving the ac-\n",
      "curacy of future analyses to be performed (Chen et al., 2014). Crucial\n",
      "data preprocessing strategies include cleaning and integration of data. The main goal of data cleaning is to identify errors and duplicates in the\n",
      "data, manage missing data, ﬁnd inconsistencies and reduce data attri-\n",
      "butes. Reducing redundancy in data is also crucial as images, videos\n",
      "and audio recordings, all of which will be important for poultry pro-\n",
      "duction, include a large amount of redundancy. The mechanisms in which big data provides value to corporations\n",
      "and industries has been reviewed, and includes tools such as trans-\n",
      "parency, experimentation, tailoring of services or products and ad-\n",
      "vanced decision making (Manika et al., 2011). These beneﬁts are all\n",
      "applicable to the poultry industry. For example, big data is able to\n",
      "create transparency, meaning that data are more readily available to\n",
      "applicable stakeholders. In the case of the poultry industry, the primary\n",
      "stakeholder is the producer, and transparency relates to the availability\n",
      "of data regarding health, weight, growth, production and welfare status\n",
      "of birds. Transparency also allows other stakeholders involved in\n",
      "poultry production to use data to aid in decision making. For example,\n",
      "if feed suppliers have access to data regarding bird weight or certain\n",
      "health parameters, modiﬁcations to feed could result. Another im-\n",
      "portant tool that big data analytics enables is experimentation in order\n",
      "to expose the strengths, needs, ﬂaws and variability in an operation. As\n",
      "corporations collect data regarding numerous variables, it becomes\n",
      "possible to manipulate certain inputs and track changes in a desired\n",
      "output. This application of big data is very valuable for poultry op-\n",
      "erations. Potentially, this could be used to achieve optimal rates of\n",
      "production through manipulation of diﬀerent inputs that aﬀect pro-\n",
      "duction, including factors that aﬀect the poultry house environment, or\n",
      "strategies related to feeding. This creates a system where outcomes of\n",
      "management changes can be accurately monitored allowing production\n",
      "to be further optimized on poultry farms. Big data also allows corporations to better serve consumers by\n",
      "collecting data on consumer trends and modifying products or services\n",
      "to more selectively suit speciﬁc consumer needs (Brown et al., 2011). Furthermore, this allows corporations to detect diﬀerent preferences\n",
      "among segmented groups of consumers, allowing for products or ser-\n",
      "vices to be tailored or advertised more speciﬁcally to these groups. As\n",
      "data are collected from diﬀerent poultry farms or diﬀerent poultry\n",
      "houses on one farm, slight diﬀerences in production can be detected,\n",
      "leading to changes in the management practices of diﬀerent farms or\n",
      "houses, resulting in optimal production from poultry operations. Perhaps the most valuable advantage that big data analytics can\n",
      "provide is the ability to create decision support systems for making\n",
      "complex decisions that humans may not be capable of making. Big data\n",
      "analytics can incorporate large volumes of data from various sources\n",
      "into decision support systems, leading to decisions that minimize risk\n",
      "and make key insights in the data that potentially would remain un-\n",
      "noticed by regular analysis methods. Poultry operations could beneﬁt\n",
      "greatly from big data driven decision making platforms. It is this aspect\n",
      "of big data analytics that will allow producers to signiﬁcantly increase\n",
      "production while minimizing resource utilization. 5.2. The internet of things (IoT) and smart poultry farming\n",
      "The IoT is a description of infrastructure where a huge variety of\n",

      "wearable sensors and imaging and audio recording devices. The IoT has\n",
      "far reaching implications in the agricultural sector and will be a part of\n",
      "smart poultry farms in the future. Implementation of IoT technologies\n",
      "in systems of poultry production will consist of a variety of internet\n",
      "connected smart devices that enable enhanced device communications,\n",
      "leading to some farm operations becoming automated, leaving humans\n",
      "to only monitor farms and act on processes that require a much higher\n",
      "level of intelligence (Wolfert et al., 2017). The main advantage the IoT provides for the poultry industry is the\n",
      "capability for communication between sensors and equipment that are\n",

      "ciency of management practices (Banhazi, 2009). In an IoT network,\n",
      "various device communications can exist, such as device-device com-\n",
      "munication, human-device communication and device-human com-\n",
      "munication (Bello and Zeadally, 2015). Simple communications could\n",
      "lead to automation of many procedures, for example, low levels of feed\n",
      "could signal an automatic order to feed suppliers, or high levels of\n",
      "humidity and ammonia gas sensed by environmental sensors could send\n",
      "a signal to increase the ventilation rate. More complex multi-device\n",
      "communications will face challenges that include a heterogeneous pool\n",
      "of devices, individual device limitations (power supply, processing\n",
      "power, storage) and inconsistent access to the network (Bello and\n",
      "Zeadally, 2015). To enable more complex multi-device communica-\n",
      "tions, intelligent routing protocols/algorithms must be instrumented. Complex routing protocols could oﬀer automation of higher order\n",

      "In most of the countries, the demand for poultry meat is \n",
      "increasing progressively because of high protein, low \n",
      "energy, and low cholesterol meat. The high production of \n",
      "chicken depends on the environment, breeding process and \n",
      "the active operations. To monitor and control the farm \n",
      "actively, in most cases sufficient manpower is required, \n",
      "however, in turn, it increases the production cost \n",
      "significantly. So, it requires a mechanism that may manage \n",
      "the poultry farm easily for better improvement in the \n",
      "production with lower cost. Usually, the poultry farms are \n",
      "located in suburbs, away from populated areas. In Pakistan, \n",
      "the increasing demand for the chicken in   hotels, marriage \n",
      "parties and the daily meal has earned increasing profit to the \n",
      "poultry industry at large. At the same time, the increasing \n",
      "global warming, particularly in Sindh and Punjab provinces \n",
      "of Pakistan where the temperature in daytime rises to 51 C0 \n",
      "has been alarming to the health of people, animals, and \n",
      "birds. The preventive measures from the scorching sunlight \n",
      "may include plenty use of water, unnecessary travel i.e.\n",

      "and protection of the parameters discussed above are \n",
      "directly related to the outcome of these farms. If these \n",
      "parameters are taken care of correctly, the health of poultry \n",
      "will be good enough and profit will increase. This can only \n",

      "SUMMARY\n",
      "There is growing acknowledgement that use of antibiotics in people is the primary driver of\n",
      "antibiotic-resistant infections in humans [1, 7–9], however, antibiotic-free production of poultry\n",
      "has become increasingly popular. Consumer perception is that antibiotic-free produced poultry\n",
      "is superior to conventionally raised poultry in spite of a lack of supporting scientific data [2]. A\n",
      "widely accepted definition of antibiotic-free poultry in the United States is that there is “no use\n",
      "of antibiotics (including ionophore anticoccidials) at the farm.” That means that coccidiosis and\n",
      "necrotic enteritis prevention must rely on synthetic or “chemical” anticoccidials, or on live coc-\n",
      "cidiosis vaccines, or on rotations between drugs and vaccines. The problem with this approach is\n",
      "that chemical anticoccidials (with the exception of nicarbazin) build coccidial resistance much\n",
      "quicker than ionophores and must be rested for a prolonged period of time. Further, there are\n",
      "limited numbers of anticoccidials of this class on the market. Moreover, unlike the ionophores,\n",
      "the chemicals do not have an antibiotic effect that aids in the prevention of necrotic enteritis and\n",
      "typically nicarbazin is only used during the cool months. Additionally, live coccidiosis vaccines\n",
      "induce immunity by invading, replicating, and cycling through the intestines. The coccidial\n",
      "infection, therefore, damages the intestinal epithelium and predisposes the birds to necrotic\n",
      "enteritis [3]. These intestinal health problems lead to bird welfare issues that must be addressed\n",
      "in the antibiotic-free production system. Likewise, it is generally acknowledged that production\n",
      "efficiency (weight gain, feed conversion ratio, mortality and yield) is adversely impacted in the\n",
      "antibiotic-free production system [4]. Thus, antibiotic-free production results in a greater car-\n",
      "bon footprint and is less efficient [5, 6]. Companies considering raising antibiotic-free poultry\n",
      "must be aware of the expected adverse effects on bird health, production efficiency, and cost. Key words: Antibiotics, Antibiotic-Free, ABF, Poultry Production\n",

      "Birds eat primarily to satisfy their energy needs, provided that \n",
      "the diet is adequate in all other essential nutrients. The energy \n",
      "level in the diet is therefore a major determinant of poultry’s feed \n",
      "intake. When the dietary energy level changes, the feed intake \n",
      "will change, and the specifications for other nutrients must be \n",
      "modified to maintain the required intake. For this reason, the di-\n",
      "etary energy level is often used as the starting point in the formu-\n",
      "lation of practical diets for poultry. Different classes of poultry need different amounts of energy \n",
      "for metabolic purposes, and a deficiency will affect productive \n",
      "performance. To sustain high productivity, modern poultry strains \n",
      "are typically fed relatively high-energy diets. The dietary energy \n",
      "levels used in a given situation are largely dictated by the availabil-\n",
      "ity and cost of energy-rich feedstuffs. Because of the high cost of \n",
      "cereals, particularly maize, the use of low-energy diets for poultry \n",
      "feeding is not uncommon in many developing countries. Protein and amino acids\n",
      "The function of dietary protein is to supply amino acids for main-\n",
      "tenance, muscle growth and synthesis of egg protein. The syn-\n",
      "thesis of muscle and egg proteins requires a supply of 20 amino \n",
      "acids, all of which are physiological requirements. Ten of these \n",
      "are either not synthesized at all or are synthesized too slowly to \n",
      "meet the metabolic requirements, and are designated as essential \n",
      "elements of the diet.\n",
      "1570\n",
      "These need to be supplied in the diet. The \n",
      "balance can be synthesised from other amino acids; these are \n",
      "referred to as dietary non-essential elements and need not be \n",
      "considered in feed formulations. From a physiological point of \n",
      "view, however, all 20 amino acids are essential for the synthesis of \n",
      "various proteins in the body. The essential amino acids for poultry \n",
      "are lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, isoleucine, leucine, \n",
      "histidine, valine, phenylalanine and arginine. In addition, some \n",
      "consider glycine to be essential for young birds. Cysteine and ty-\n",
      "rosine are considered semi-essential amino acids, because they \n",
      "can be synthesized from methionine and phenylalanine, respec-\n",
      "tively. Of the ten essential amino acids, lysine, methionine and \n",
      "threonine are the most limiting in most practical poultry diets. Poultry do not have a requirement for protein per se. However, \n",
      "an adequate dietary supply of nitrogen from protein is essential to \n",
      "synthesize non-essential amino acids. This ensures that the essen-\n",
      "tial amino acids are not used to supply the nitrogen for the syn-\n",
      "thesis of non-essential amino acids. Satisfying the recommended \n",
      "requirements for both protein and essential amino acids therefore \n",
      "ensures the provision of all amino acids to meet the birds’ physi-\n",
      "ological needs. The amino acid requirements of poultry are influ-\n",
      "enced by several factors, including production level, genotype, \n",
      "sex, physiological status, environment and health status. For ex-\n",
      "ample, high levels of lean meat deposition require relatively high \n",
      "levels of lysine. High levels of egg output or feather growth re-\n",
      "quire relatively high levels of methionine. However, most changes \n",
      "in amino acid requirements do not lead to changes in the relative \n",
      "proportions of the different amino acids. There is therefore an \n",
      "ideal balance of dietary amino acids for poultry, and changes in \n",
      "amino acid requirements are normally expressed in relation to a \n",
      "balanced protein or ideal protein. Fats and fatty acids\n",
      "Because of the greater energy density of fat compared with \n",
      "carbohydrates and protein, poultry diets usually include fats to \n",
      "achieve the needed dietary energy concentration. Fat accounts \n",
      "for about 3 to no more than 5 percent of most practical diets. Other benefits of using fats include better dust control in feed \n",

      "of protein, minerals and vitamins is often high during the rainy \n",

      "and phosphorus. It is therefore recognized that scavenging alone \n",
      "will not provide enough feed to support the needs for growth or \n",

      "levels are known, it may be possible to dilute the contaminated \n",

      "the critical level of the specific mycotoxin. Such blending of feeds \n",

      "spp. can grow both before and after harvest. However, the pres-\n",

      "fects of a mycotoxin because they are not necessarily unique to \n",

      "conditions in which it lives (www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_\n",
      "chapitre_1.7.1.htm). This definition, derived from Broom (1986), \n",
      "has widespread, but not universal, acceptance. Other authors \n",
      "continue to emphasize the importance of animals’ feelings and \n",
      "experiences in their definitions of animal welfare (Phillips, 2009). For the purposes of this review, the concept of animal welfare \n",
      "refers to an animal’s overall state of well-being. OIE considers that \n",
      "good animal welfare requires disease prevention and veterinary \n",
      "treatment, appropriate shelter, management, nutrition, humane \n",
      "handling and humane slaughter/killing. In general, many differ-\n",
      "ent components of an animal’s state must be considered to judge \n",
      "whether its welfare is good or bad. Some of the components that \n",
      "FAO considers important are that the animal should be healthy, \n",
      "comfortable, well nourished, and safe. It is also important that \n",
      "animals are able to express behaviours that are priorities in a cap-\n",
      "tive environment (Weeks and Nicol, 2006) and that they should \n",
      "not suffer from unpleasant mental states such as pain, fear and \n",
      "distress (although these feelings cannot be measured directly). When considering animal welfare as a whole, it is important to \n",
      "take each of these components into consideration. Measuring animal welfare\n",
      "The state of an animal’s welfare can range from very good to \n",
      "very bad (Duncan and Fraser, 1997). Sometimes, however, one \n",
      "component of welfare is good but others are not. For example, an \n",

      "are many links between poor welfare and poor health/disease. Improving one can often improve the other. • If possible, obtain birds from rearing units close to the laying \n",
      "farm, as this will minimize stress during transfer. The new laying \n",
      "flock will settle more easily and early egg production is likely to \n",
      "be improved. • Do not bring the flock into lay too early. Onset of lay at 17 or \n",
      "18 weeks is associated with a greater risk of vent pecking than \n",
      "onset of lay at 19 weeks. • Do not place perches at heights that permit one bird to peck \n",
      "another bird’s vent. • The use of mash rather than pelleted feed allows the hens to \n",
      "spend a longer time feeding, and reduces the risk of injurious \n",
      "pecking. • The provision of good, dry litter to a depth of at least 10 cm is \n",
      "vital for the good management of hens in non-cage systems. • For birds in non-cage systems, provide a raised slatted or wire \n",
      "mesh area separate from the litter area. Do not provide high \n",

      "growth rates have increased from 25 g per day to 100 g per day \n",

      "assessed, and the chlorine content of the materials was measured using iodometric thiosulfate titration over a 4-week period. Antimicrobial activities were evaluated by a sandwich test on each sampling day during 4 weeks of storage. On the samples\n",
      "treated with 1% MC, bacteria at 6 log CFU per coupon were completely inactivated within 2 h of contact time. The antimicrobial\n",
      "activity extended to 4 weeks, and the active chlorine atoms in the treated materials decreased from the initial 1016 to 1015 atoms\n",
      "per cm2. Overall, MC had high stability and long-lasting antimicrobial activity, which suggests that MC has high potential for use\n",

      "proportional to the quantity and contact time with MC. A\n",
      "higher concentration of MC and longer contact time\n",
      "enhanced the antimicrobial efﬁcacy, which is in agreement\n",
      "with results of a previous study (6). In the present study, MC\n",
      "at a lower concentration (0.02%) was still able to effectively\n",
      "inactivate Salmonella Typhimurium and C. jejuni in a short\n",
      "period of time. To further assess the antimicrobial efﬁcacy of MC in the\n",
      "ﬁeld, antimicrobial longevity and stability tests were\n",
      "performed on MC-treated facility surfaces. For all of the\n",
      "materials treated with 1% MC, the inoculated microorgan-\n",
      "isms were completely inactivated on each test day during 4\n",
      "weeks of storage, which indicates that the antimicrobial\n",
      "activity of MC is quite stable on facility and equipment\n",
      "surfaces. This stability may be attributed to the speciﬁc\n",
      "amine structure MC; methyl groups are located on the\n",
      "carbon ring adjacent to the N-Cl moiety, which can stabilize\n",
      "the N-Cl bond either by steric hindrance or by the electron\n",
      "donor effect of the methyl groups (11). Compared with the disinfectants currently used in\n",
      "broiler houses (8, 17, 20), the MC compound has higher\n",
      "antimicrobial effectiveness and offers other advantages. Speciﬁcally, chlorine-based products, such as sodium\n",
      "hypochlorite, can lose their disinfection power in the\n",
      "presence of organic matter (19). Quaternary ammonium\n",
      "compounds are not recommended for use in poultry\n",
      "production because of their insufﬁcient disinfectant activity\n",

      "inadequate antibacterial effectiveness of these compounds,\n",
      "their pungent odors, corrosiveness, and short shelf life are\n",
      "other disadvantages. Formaldehyde and peroxygen com-\n",

      "formaldehyde is not permitted for use in poultry production\n",

      "has a long-lasting antimicrobial effect when coated on\n",
      "contact surfaces. It is not corrosive to equipment surfaces\n",
      "and does not have a pungent odor. These characteristics\n",
      "suggest that MC is an outstanding candidate for use as an\n",
      "antimicrobial agent in broiler houses. The antimicrobial activity of MC is related to its\n",
      "chlorine concentration. Results of a previous study indicated\n",
      "that effective antimicrobial activity (a 6-log reduction per\n",
      "coupon) required active chlorine at 1017 atoms per cm2 (18). In the present study, even when the active chlorine\n",
      "concentration was decreased to 5.85 3 1015 atoms per\n",

      "workers[1][2]. But as the demand for poultry products \n",
      "increased so is the size of the poultry farms. Due to fragile \n",
      "and disease prone nature of the chickens and hens, it is \n",
      "essential to monitor the livestock at the individual bird \n",
      "level so that the symptoms of different diseases can be \n",
      "detected in time for containing the disease outbreak. Obviously, if the farm is managed by human workers \n",
      "alone, the required number of workers to monitor the \n",
      "livestock on individual bird level is substantially higher, \n",
      "that in turn results in the escalation of production costs. Also, due to the engagement of more number of human \n",
      "workers the natural habitat of poultry birds gets affected  \n",
      " \n",
      "by human workers. Additionally, it raises concerns about \n",
      "the health of workers in the poultry business. As most of \n",
      "the diseases in poultry birds are highly contagious and \n",
      "communicable, these affect humans too. It becomes a very \n",
      "dangerous situation in case any fatal disease originates in \n",
      "poultry. This whole scenario creates a need to employ modern \n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "There is a worldwide movement to support a sustainable agricultural system that involves\n",
      "sustaining farmers, resources, and societies. It is expected that this can be achieved by upgrading\n",
      "farming practices that are proﬁtable, environmentally sound, good for communities, and antibiotic-free. However, raising animals without antibiotics is a challenge, and especially, antibiotic-free broiler\n",
      "meat production is a growing challenge in many developing countries, including Bangladesh,\n",
      "where antibiotics are used injudiciously [1]. Broiler chickens are reared particularly for meat production\n",
      "because of their typical soft, tender meat, low-fat content, and short production period. Broilers take\n",
      "the place of valuable food animals globally by notably contributing to food security, protein supply,\n",
      "and people’s employment [2]. Sustainable broiler production not only requires maximum productivity\n",
      "but, also, includes bird and human welfare and environmental protection. In addition, consumers\n",
      "are concerned about antibiotic residue and antimicrobial resistance, as well as pesticide residues,\n",
      "additives, nutritional content, ﬂavor, traceability, regional production, genetically modiﬁed organisms,\n",
      "social justice, etc., with regards to broiler meat production. Therefore, broiler meat production\n",
      "without using antibiotics is crucial in the battle of antimicrobial resistance to save poultry, animals,\n",
      "and public health. Broiler meat production has undergone exponential growth for global consumption and\n",
      "business proﬁt. Low production costs and rapid economic progress are pivotal in its expansion [3].\n",
      "1768\n",
      "Though commercial poultry farming is a proﬁtable business, it faces a number of challenges. Among them, the occurrence of infectious and noninfectious diseases is a major challenge due\n",
      "to poor biosecurity and husbandry practices. Over several decades, some antibiotics have been used\n",
      "in broiler feed to control, prevent, and treat diseases and boost performance and feed eﬃcacy [4,5]. This inappropriate antibacterial use favors antimicrobial resistance. The most common pathway\n",
      "for bacteria to gain resistance is through mobile genetic components, including bacteriophages,\n",
      "plasmids, naked DNA, or transposons. Plasmid-mediated gene transfer facilitates the ﬂow of\n",
      "resistant genes between bacteria, accelerating antibiotic resistance [6]. Bacteria can also develop\n",
      "antibiotic resistance through sequential mutations in the chromosome, as happens in ﬂuoroquinolone\n",
      "resistance. Using normal genetic variations, bacterial populations mutate to render antibiotics\n",
      "ineﬀective against them [7]. Indeed, antibiotic resistance begins with the interaction between bacteria\n",
      "and antibiotic, leading to the removal of sensitive bacteria and selection of resistant populations. However, the distribution and assortment of resistance are complicated matters that pose a severe\n",
      "public health problem [8]. The indiscriminant use of antibiotics in nonbacterial infections like inﬂuenza\n",
      "and other viral infections facilitates antibiotic resistance [9]. In Bangladesh, commercial poultry farmers extensively utilize antibiotics without any veterinary\n",
      "advice and often do not follow withdrawal period guidelines [10]. A lack of both easily accessible\n",
      "veterinary facilities and adequate knowledge combined with a high-proﬁt motive are some of the\n",
      "factors that drive local producers to inappropriate and, at times, illegal use of antimicrobial agents [11]. The cost-eﬀective production of broilers may act as a driver for the practice of using growth-promoting\n",
      "medicines, including antibiotics, for the overall growth performance [12,13]. These agents get stored in\n",
      "various body parts and tissues, resulting in antibiotic residues for unintended exposure to consumers.\n",
      "2147\n",
      "Sattar et al. [14] reported antibiotic residues mostly in the liver, kidney, thigh meat, and breast meat\n",
      "of broilers. Easy access to antibiotics from registered veterinarians by farmers without prescriptions\n",
      "contributes to the indiscriminant use of antibiotics, which can result in antimicrobial resistance from\n",
      "food animals [11]. Although antibiotic resistance has always been present in nature, antibiotic pressure\n",
      "due to inappropriate use facilitated the rapid and widespread emergence of drug-resistant pathogenic\n",

      "bacteria [15]. As several antibiotics frequently consumed by livestock are identical to those used in\n",
      "humans, there is worldwide fear that antibiotic-resistant bacteria may be transferred from animals\n",
      "to humans, leading to severe public health concerns [16]. Resistant bacteria with resistant genes can\n",
      "quickly spread among humans, animals, and the ecological community. Therefore, new approaches\n",
      "should be considered for antibiotic-free broiler production so they can be sustainably raised and\n",
      "marketed. Therefore, this review highlights the current scenario of antibiotic use in broiler meat\n",
      "production, as well as the global challenges, prospects, and approaches of antibiotic-free production,\n",
      "particularly in the context of Bangladesh. 2. Economic and Clinical Importance of Antibiotic-Free Broiler Meat Production\n",
      "The fast growth of the poultry industry has been attained through the eﬀective implementation\n",
      "of high-yielding strains of meat-type chickens and the availability of nutritionally balanced feed. Broiler farming plays a central role in enhancing income, improving food safety, and mitigating\n",
      "scarcity in the countryside and in semi-urban communities in developing countries. For a couple of\n",
      "decades, the poultry industry has played a critical role in the economic development of Bangladesh by\n",
      "providing job opportunities, food security, and good-quality protein. The poultry industry has assisted\n",
      "in changing living and food habits by moderating animal protein sources such as beef and mutton. For instance, about 44% of the protein for everyday human consumption comes from poultry and\n",
      "animal products [17]. As a primary portion of production, this industry’s ability to furnish the country\n",
      "with aﬀordable and nourishing protein in the form of meat and eggs is encouraging [18]. There are over\n",
      "a million small and large poultry farms, 80 grandparent (GP) stock farms, 130 parent stock farms and\n",
      "hatcheries, and over 50 feed mills across the country, making up a USD 2.36 billion industry. About ﬁve\n",
      "million people are employed in the industry directly and indirectly. A study estimated that around\n",
      "150,000 poultry farms in Bangladesh are producing 570 million tons of meat and 7.334 billion eggs\n",
      "annually, and about 68.17% of animal protein consumed comes from poultry meat [19]. A signiﬁcant\n",
      "number of pastoral individuals depend on this business for their income.\n",
      "2413\n",
      "The poultry industry has\n",
      "made up one-third of the entire agronomic contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (18.60%)\n",
      "in recent years [20]. In food animal production, antibiotics are also exploited, albeit unwisely, to advance animal growth\n",
      "and feed eﬃciency [21,22]. Generally, farmers in developing countries use antibiotics deliberately to\n",
      "promote growth without any veterinary consultation. Additionally, shockingly, 88% of producers\n",
      "did not adhere to the required antibiotic withdrawal time before marketing [22]. On the other hand,\n",
      "only 10% of farmers stopped using antibiotics before marketing, and only 2% of farmers withdrew\n",
      "antibiotics at least seven days before marketing. Still, they did not always follow this withdrawal\n",
      "protocol [23].\n",
      "755\n",
      "Generally, excessive and unnecessary use of medicines aﬀects the total cost of production. A study on the antibiotic usage patterns in Bangladesh concluded that the use of antibiotics has an\n",
      "economic eﬀect on broiler production [11]. Another study revealed that the cost of antibiotic usage\n",
      "could be 3.53% of the overall production rate based on responses from 84% of farmers [23]. The cost\n",
      "of antibiotics varies from farm to farm due to the presence and severity of diseases and their use as\n",
      "growth promoters. Removing antibiotics from broilers can lower the production cost and, thereby,\n",
      "decrease the market price of broiler meat. The nontherapeutic use of antibiotics increases the residual accumulation more than medically\n",
      "necessary to use and, thereby, increases the incidence of antimicrobial resistance. The consumption of\n",
      "residual medicines through animal food products (e.g., meat, milk) is assumed to initiate resistance\n",
      "development in humans. Besides, commensal bacteria of livestock are often present in fresh meat,\n",
      "which can serve as reservoirs of resistant genes to be relocated to pathogenic bacteria in humans [7]. Studies have shown that antibiotic residues were present in more than 50% of samples of broiler and\n",
      "layer meat collected in diﬀerent regions of Bangladesh [14,22]. Another study by Faiz and Bashe\n",
      "(2011) reported that some pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi,\n",
      "are resistant to commonly used antibiotics [24]. The high degree of antibiotics resistance in Bangladesh\n",
      "1531\n",
      "Biology 2020, 9, 0411\n",
      "4 of 24\n",
      "poses a regional and global threat [25]. In Bangladesh, diarrhea accounts for around 230,000 child\n",
      "deaths annually, and a signiﬁcant portion is due to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection [19]. 3. Prospects of Antibiotic-Free Broiler Meat Production\n",
      "In veterinary practice, antibiotics are used for prophylactic, therapeutic, and growth-promoting\n",
      "purposes. The purchase of medicines without a prescription is common in developing countries\n",
      "like Bangladesh. This can lead to an inadequate course of treatment, incorrect antibiotic selection,\n",
      "indiscriminant and excessive use, and enhanced residual deposition in animal bodies. A recent study\n",
      "with 160 poultry samples from diﬀerent regions in Bangladesh identiﬁed antibiotics in more than\n",
      "50% of the samples [22]. Producing a suﬃcient amount of food for a growing population is a great\n",
      "challenge for any country. Of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 14 are connected to\n",
      "the poultry sector in some way or other. According to data from the Bangladesh Poultry Industries\n",
      "Central Council (BPICC), the annual commercial production of eggs and poultry meat is about\n",
      "to 1022 crore pieces and 14.6 lakh tons, respectively. Thus, the poultry industry appears to be a\n",
      "big sector, worth about USD 353.88 crore [26]. Nowadays, consumers are refusing to consume\n",
      "antibiotic-treated chicken and demanding safe, antibiotic-free beef. Therefore, there is a large market\n",
      "for antibiotic-free chicken in Bangladesh. The challenge is to ﬁnd a way to produce them. One option\n",
      "would be to use medicinal plants instead of antibiotics as growth promoters. Bangladesh is rich in\n",
      "medicinal plants, and many such plants have been shown to have antibacterial activities, such as\n",
      "Abutilon indicum L., Caesalpinia bonduc L., Ixora nigricans L., etc. Many natural foods also have\n",
      "antibacterial actions, such as broccoli (Brassica oleracea), guava (Psidium guajava), garlic (Allium sativum),\n",
      "and okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) [27–30]. Based on antibacterial medicinal plants and natural foods,\n",
      "a safe antibacterial preparation could be developed to use in food animals as an alternative to antibiotics\n",
      "for growth promotion and feeding eﬃciency.\n",
      "2204\n",
      "4. Signiﬁcant Challenges for Sustainable Antibiotic-Free Broilers Production\n",
      "Bangladesh is a developing country, and its seasonal variations are very distinct, categorized\n",
      "by extreme temperatures, excessive humidity, and heavy rainfall. The environment is beneﬁcial\n",
      "for the survival and growth of various microorganisms and makes them ubiquitous and fastidious.\n",
      "361\n",
      "Most poultry farmers are not well-educated or well-trained for modern scientiﬁc farming. It is\n",
      "estimated that about 80% of farmers lack adequate knowledge about rearing current high-yielding\n",
      "strains [23]. Moreover, farmers in Bangladesh can quickly get antibiotics from local vendors without a\n",
      "veterinarian’s prescription. Biosecurity measures are also terrible; thus, the entry of microorganisms on\n",
      "most farms is common, aﬀecting the production performance of ﬂocks. The commercial livestock sector\n",
      "is multiplying and conveying a lot of diseases with it. Thus, biosecurity must be implemented without\n",
      "fail [26]. Newcastle disease, Gumboro or infectious bursal disease, Marek’s disease, duck plague,\n",
      "fowl pox, fowl cholera, leucosis, and infectious bronchitis are among the most common infectious\n",
      "diseases in the poultry sector [26]. It is therefore essential to control primary and secondary infections\n",
      "for successful poultry farming in Bangladesh. One of the most critical factors in antibiotic-free broiler\n",
      "production is the economic challenge, i.e., cost management. The most critical challenges in producing\n",

      "Figure 1. Schematic presentation of the challenges in sustainable antibiotic-free broiler production. 4.1. Environment\n",
      "Whatever system is followed in any corner of the world, none can deny that environmental\n",
      "pollution is a part of broiler production. Disease and mortality are likely to increase due to polluted\n",
      "and hazardous environments. Increased clinical and subclinical necrotic enteritis (NE) and related\n",
      "disorders, including cholangiohepatitis, on poultry farms are the likely consequences. Therefore,\n",
      "it is vital to keep the level of pollution to a minimum for the well-being of both birds and humans. To achieve this goal, farmers should prioritize proper carcass disposal and waste management during\n",
      "farm operations. While about 70% of all agricultural land globally is occupied by livestock [31],\n",
      "poultry farming’s eﬀect on agricultural land loss is minimal [32]. However, another study suggested\n",
      "that feed production, processing, and transport result in a greater overall environmental impact\n",
      "than any other part of broiler production [33,34]. Therefore, farmers must follow the principles of\n",
      "poultry production, upholding public interest, as well as a hazard-free environment, thereby ensuring\n",
      "sustainable antibiotic-free poultry meat production. 4.2.\n",
      "1296\n",
      "Resource Management\n",
      "Resource management is the process by which farm owners eﬀectively utilize their tangible\n",
      "and intangible resources. It involves eﬀective planning to ensure that the right resources are\n",
      "assigned to the right tasks. Broiler meat production without the use of antibiotics requires farmers to\n",
      "decrease the stocking density, raise the downtime, clean rapidly and frequently, maintain the correct\n",
      "temperature, provide rigorous biosecurity, reduce hassle, select the best breed, etc. Therefore, it is a\n",
      "signiﬁcant undertaking for the eﬃcient utilization of limited resources in broiler farming management. Broiler production and meat processing require an adequate supply of water. Thus, inadequate\n",
      "water availability is a signiﬁcant obstacle to sustainable antibiotic-free broiler meat production [35]. Another relevant aspect of resource management is feeding the poultry.\n",
      "887\n",
      "There is competition between\n",
      "poultry and humans for quality proteins. This creates a challenge when a protein-rich foodstuﬀ(wheat\n",
      "and maize) needs to be included in the supplied ration [36,37]. 4.3. Antibiotics\n",
      "Despite increasing concerns, antibiotics are used worldwide on poultry farms, particularly broiler\n",
      "farms, to treat and prevent diseases and as growth promoters to improve meat production [38–40]. Antibiotics are commonly used to treat intestinal infections caused by Salmonella, Escherichia coli (E. coli),\n",
      "or Clostridium spp. These pathogens can negatively impact poultry farming and farmers’ proﬁt. A recent\n",
      "620\n",
      "Biology 2020, 9, 0411\n",
      "6 of 24\n",
      "study demonstrated the patterns of antibiotic use at selected broiler farms in Bangladesh, with reported\n",
      "use for therapy (43.8%), prevention (31.5%), or both (47.9%), and for promoting growth (8.2%) [11]. However, antibiotic use varies from nation to nation depending on several factors, including knowledge,\n",
      "economy, management system, and farming practices [41]. Although the monitoring of antibiotic use\n",
      "is essential, it is poorly implemented around the world, including in Bangladesh [40]. According to\n",
      "a recent estimate, the average annual global consumption of antimicrobials per kilogram of chicken\n",
      "production was 148 mg [42]. Furthermore, a rise of the antimicrobial consumption by 67% was\n",
      "projected [42]. The widespread use of antibiotics on broiler farms could encourage antibiotic resistance,\n",
      "ultimately causing a global public health threat [43]. Alternative approaches should be investigated\n",
      "to replace growth-promoting antibiotics to maintain and ensure gut health and good-quality meat\n",
      "production. However, producing quality broiler meat at consumer-friendly prices without antibiotics\n",
      "will be a challenge. 4.4. Breed Diversity\n",
      "In the modern period, it is evident that there is minimal breed and genetic variability among\n",
      "commercial birds. Researchers have found that the breed or genetic diversity of commercial chicken\n",
      "farms has declined in the developed world. This is mainly because modern industrialized agriculture\n",
      "depends, in no small degree, on uniformity. There are hundreds of breeds of poultry that are\n",
      "well-recognized and registered. Most of these poultry breeds and varieties are locally adapted for\n",
      "multiple purposes and suited to various farming enterprises. They are mostly reared under small-hold\n",
      "production systems and are a large part of poultry meat production worldwide. On the contrary,\n",
      "modern chicken strains are raised for either meat or eggs, and only limited high-producer strains are\n",
      "employed. However, such top-yielding hybrids are more susceptible because of their compromised\n",
      "immune capacity [44]. Not cultivating other breeds means not only sacriﬁcing the natural genetic\n",
      "diversity but, also, decreasing the birds’ potential to adapt to new conditions and circumstances,\n",
      "such as climate changes [45]. It is noteworthy that genetic uniformity or a lack of genetic diversity\n",
      "makes birds more vulnerable to many diseases. While it is convenient and proﬁtable to mass-produce\n",
      "a particular breed, the loss of diversity makes it more challenging to adapt to changes [46]. 4.5. Social Aspects\n",
      "Two social issues, working environments and human health, and the impartiality of job agreements,\n",
      "including health care, fair wages, and cooperative trading rights, are signiﬁcant matters in sustainable\n",
      "broiler production. Poultry farmers and their family members risk becoming contaminated with\n",
      "antibiotic-resistant bacteria and developing antibiotic allergies. Health ailments in farm workers due\n",
      "to exposure to dust, litter, and feathers are quite common [47] and should receive attention to assure\n",
      "production continuity. According to Quandt et al. [48], “chicken grabbing” in the USA is characterized\n",
      "by a working atmosphere and work organization that encourages accidents and illness and is closely\n",
      "connected to the risk of disease, human rights, and overall working environments. Workers are\n",
      "exploited disproportionately in food-producing industries such as the poultry sector. For example,\n",
      "healthy working conditions are not maintained in order to keep the direct costs of production low. Besides, the terms and conditions with contract growers vary greatly and, in some cases, are grossly\n",
      "unreasonable [49,50].\n",
      "3680\n",
      "4.6. Gender Issue\n",
      "Among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015,\n",
      "promoting gender egalitarianism and empowering women is noteworthy. Commercial poultry\n",
      "production on an industrial scale does not ﬁrmly follow this gender goal. However, small-scale family\n",
      "poultry production with low input is mostly run by women in most Asian and African countries. Such a\n",
      "production system supplies much-needed poultry meat and eggs for the proper nutrition of millions of\n",
      "people worldwide and helps reduce poverty and improve incomes in rural areas. Dolberg et al.\n",

      "Biology 2020, 9, 0411\n",
      "7 of 24\n",
      "reported that women are actively involved in various aspects of small-scale poultry production in\n",
      "rural households. While women are often responsible for taking care of poultry, they usually face\n",
      "more critical challenges than men. Women have less access to and inﬂuence over property, credit,\n",
      "labor, technology, and the facilities required to take advantage of development opportunities. In some\n",
      "instances, they do not have full control or decision-making authority over the birds or the revenue\n",
      "from their sale [52]. Further, the keeping of family poultry (FP) is typically the responsibility of women. Unfortunately, there is a lack of knowledge of women’s and men’s particular roles in FP production;\n",
      "this results in gender blindness. Therefore, the contribution of women to this subsector of poultry\n",
      "remains invisible [53]. Thus, the gender issue is a massive challenge in sustainable antibiotic-free\n",
      "broiler meat production in Bangladesh. 4.7.\n",
      "978\n",
      "Animal Welfare\n",
      "It is imperative that we look after the welfare of animals that serve us in so many ways. Humanity\n",
      "demands it. With the advancement of time, the animal welfare issue has become a matter of great\n",
      "concern. The suﬀering of poultry caused intentionally or unintentionally cannot be justiﬁed in any\n",
      "production [54]. The Animal Welfare Standards research project funded by the EU laid down 12\n",
      "standards for animal protection. For example, poultry should not be stressed from excessive hunger or\n",
      "thirst, should have room for free movement, and should show usual nonharmful behavior. Poultry\n",
      "producers should promote positive emotions and avoid negative emotions, such as fear, distress,\n",
      "frustration, and apathy. These criteria are currently not fulﬁlled by many producers, and some poultry\n",
      "production systems may cause suﬀering [55]. Skipping a day of feeding broiler breeders to control their\n",
      "body weight aﬀects the chickens’ welfare under the modern husbandry system. This practice needs\n",
      "the attention of researchers to ensure the sustainability of production in the future. It is interesting to\n",
      "note that some studies recommend providing low-density feeds to increase female broiler breeders\n",
      "as an alternative to feeding constraints [56]. Any improvement in animal welfare also upgrades the\n",
      "sustainability and is less harmful to the environment. Nevertheless, it is challenging to balance the\n",
      "relationship between poultry production, animal welfare, and the impact of production on the ground. Organic animal production is often set in with sustainability, which can lead consumers to think that\n",
      "animals raised organically have better welfare. Although some organic poultry systems uphold high\n",
      "levels of interest, it can be challenging to maintain good health and well-being on organic poultry\n",
      "farms [57]. 4.8. Institutional Aspects\n",
      "The institutional dimensions of sustainability comprise the management and governance of global\n",
      "processes and ensure that organizations are responsible, accountable, and transparent to their members\n",
      "and representatives. Indeed, a few breeding corporations dominate a signiﬁcant part of the industry,\n",
      "making it hard for small businesses to start up.\n",
      "2192\n",
      "The producer should balance the multiple interests\n",
      "inherent in the principle of sustainability with the management of operations. Although Bangladesh’s\n",
      "government has many policies to meet the SDGs to tackle the economic, environmental, and social\n",
      "aspects, there is still no poultry policy to coordinate with other enterprises. One policy in a ﬁeld\n",
      "often hampers advancement in another. Solutions to diﬃcult problems are sometimes in the hands of\n",
      "policymakers in diﬀerent industries or at various government levels. It is a signiﬁcant cause of many\n",
      "unsustainable long-term patterns [46]. The sustainability of poultry production involves producing\n",
      "suﬃcient outputs to provide satisfactory products for consumers and income for farmers and constant\n",
      "availability of the required inputs such as raw materials, labor, and capital in the long term. On a\n",
      "biological basis, the production of village-based poultry in Bangladesh is almost sustainable. Almost all\n",
      "of the necessary feed is found through scavenging, and home-grown grain and byproducts serve as\n",
      "feed supplements. Although poultry meat and egg productivity has increased continuously during\n",
      "the last decades, it is questionable whether the consequent rapidly rising need for poultry products\n",
      "will be fulﬁlled in the future. The challenges of small-scale and comprehensive poultry production\n",

      "have been discussed previously [58]. In recent years, Bangladesh’s action plan to train vast numbers of\n",
      "rural extension staﬀand coordinate the supply of vaccines at the rural level has been useful. There is\n",
      "also a need to ensure the long-term viability of the organizational structure and training programs.\n",
      "337\n",
      "4.9. Consumption Pattern and Demand for Poultry Products\n",
      "The requirements for poultry products will be doubled in 2050 based on the rising usage in recent\n",
      "decades [49]. It is believed that today’s food insecurity problems are not due to a shortage of food but,\n",
      "rather, to poor people’s ability to aﬀord it. Increasing consumption patterns in some countries will\n",
      "demand increased production. In contrast, as people grow wealthier, the demand for healthier “green”\n",
      "diets or organic foods will increase in some other countries [46]. On the other hand, the indiscriminate\n",
      "use of antibiotics or other harmful substances in the production chain negatively aﬀects consumers’ trust\n",
      "in broiler meat. These results negatively impact market demand, as observed recently in Bangladesh.\n",
      "773\n",
      "A lack of conﬁdence in the product threatens sustainable production, causing colossal loss to the\n",
      "industry. Farmers must balance order, supply, and consumption patterns in a transparent and healthy\n",
      "competitive environment. Further, the quality of feeds and feeding programs is also a component of\n",
      "sustainable broiler production. The purpose of a feeding program is to feed the chickens and not the\n",
      "bacteria. A successful feeding program is essential in antibiotic-free broiler production. Poor-quality\n",
      "feed ingredients, rancid animal byproducts in the feed, and mycotoxin contamination can damage gut\n",
      "health and the intestinal epithelium. Therefore, excellent feed ingredients are essential to keep proper\n",
      "gut health, as well as better ﬂock health. However, these ingredients will increase the production cost\n",
      "unless the savings from not using antibiotics can oﬀset the cost of quality feed. This is an important\n",
      "consideration, since consumers in Bangladesh are demanding high-quality products but are unwilling\n",
      "to pay more. Therefore, it may be a signiﬁcant challenge to supply antibiotic-free broiler meat at a\n",
      "price desired by consumers. 5. Possibilities of Antibiotic-Free Broiler Production\n",

      "2235\n",
      "In this case, new\n",
      "ﬂock entry should be restricted to a minimum of 14 days (downtime) with good cleanout (clearing\n",
      "out birds and removing the litter cake). The downtime should start when birds are out of the house\n",
      "production site. 5.2. Optimum Stocking Density\n",
      "The stocking density is a crucial concern for proﬁtable broiler farming. As the stocking density\n",
      "increases, so does the stress level of birds. Increased stress is associated with compromised immunity\n",
      "and, consequently, an increased susceptibility to disease. Thus, decreasing stress by increasing the\n",
      "stock density can help reduce the risk of disease and the need for antibiotics. A reduced stocking\n",
      "density is also an excellent option to help keep litter moisture at a minimum compared to the current\n",
      "conventional program. Farmers should decrease the stocking density, which, in turn, reduces the\n",
      "shedding of cocci oocyst and pathogenic bacteria. This practice also helps in proper ventilation and\n",
      "aeration and, thus, reduces stress. However, the ideal stock density is still being debated. Bilgili and\n",
      "Hess [59] reported a signiﬁcant improvement of the overall growth performance, carcass quality,\n",
      "and mortality with a decreased stock density. In Bangladesh, usually 1- to 1.5-square-feet of ﬂoor space\n",
      "is assigned to each bird. However, in antibiotic-free broiler production, providing more space than\n",
      "required is an important factor.\n",

      "Biology 2020, 9, 0411\n",
      "10 of 24\n",
      "5.3. Good Litter Management\n",
      "Keeping the litter dry is critical in the overall management of any poultry farm, as it inﬂuences the\n",
      "bird performance by decreasing the ammonia level and, thereby, the growers’ proﬁts. Dry waste and\n",
      "low ammonia levels are the keys to success in raising poultry. The negative impact of ammonia on bird\n",
      "performance is well-documented [60,61]. Dry litter controls the ammonia levels and provides a better\n",
      "ﬂock atmosphere and reduces disapproval due to contact dermatitis and inﬂamed bursa. When unused\n",
      "bedding materials start to hold moisture, it will clump together to form caking, leading to increased\n",
      "ammonia formation. Caking is mainly due to moisture in the litter and can be prevented by having\n",
      "adequate ventilation. Broilers drink approximately two pounds of water for every pound of feed\n",
      "they consume. About 20% of the water is used for growth, while most of it eventually reaches the\n",
      "litter as waste. Therefore, there must be adequate ventilation to remove moisture within the waste\n",
      "to prevent caking. Generally overventilation is needed to ﬁx the problem once caking has started. Growers should attend to litter sanitation and treatment at regular intervals. It is a great idea to monitor\n",
      "the ammonia levels regularly, and handheld sensors can accurately manage them. Amending the litter\n",
      "and providing adequate ventilation are the most practical ways to control ammonia and improve litter\n",
      "quality [62]. Preventive fan maintenance can aid in keeping the ventilation program eﬀective. A total\n",
      "litter cleanout at least once a year is highly recommended. 5.4.\n",
      "1622\n",
      "Control Environment Housing\n",
      "Producers can reduce bacterial growth and antibiotic use by maintaining the adequate ventilation\n",
      "of poultry housing facilities. A study reported the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the air of\n",
      "broiler chicken facilities [63]. Dust is an excellent carrier of bacteria, while mold is a potential source\n",
      "of infection. For appropriate airing, heat, relative moisture, and light, an environmentally controlled\n",
      "structure should be built oriented in the east-to-west direction longitudinally, with large exhaust\n",
      "fans on the west side and evaporative chilling plugs on the east side, accompanied by programmed\n",
      "feeding and drinking methods inside [64]. Chick suppliers can provide useful information on the ideal\n",
      "temperature, humidity, and air quality for raising broilers. Airborne dispersion of antibiotic-resistant\n",
      "bacteria should not be underestimated, considering the respiratory health of chickens and poultry\n",
      "workers. Farmers should follow the standard guidelines for maintaining adequate ventilation [64].\n",
      "1044\n",
      "5.5. Pre-Starter Feed\n",
      "Pre-starter feed is crucial in establishing good gut microbe populations. To achieve a balance in gut\n",
      "microbiota for nutritional enhancement of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, boost the immune development,\n",
      "and facilitate nutrient absorption, it is useful to include probiotics, prebiotics, organic acids, short-\n",
      "and medium-chain fatty acids, and phytogenic feed. The broiler industry has achieved noteworthy\n",
      "advances in productivity by prioritizing the hereditary selection, diet, and controlling procedures. The\n",
      "nutrition for broilers is focused on the need to get to the market weight as quickly as possible. There is\n",
      "a growing interest in a speciﬁcally designed pre-starter feed for 10–14 days of broiler growth, since\n",
      "this represents more than 20% of the growth time [65]. A specialized formulation should ensure that\n",
      "the feed is easily digestible and meets the broiler’s nutritional needs. The eﬃcacy of pre-starter diets\n",
      "relies on the potential carryover eﬀect to increase the bird performance until market age. The nutrient\n",
      "requirements, particularly digestible amino acids, are crucial in the broiler’s ﬁrst 10 days. Rice and its\n",
      "lower non-starch polysaccharide substance may be a better option than corn or wheat for pre-starter\n",
      "diets. Additionally, the addition of ﬁbrous components in low-ﬁber feeds at earlier stages may enhance\n",
      "the gut development and improve nutrient absorption, eventually enhancing the overall growth\n",
      "performance. Finally, the manufacturer should concentrate on feed formulations to remove antibiotic\n",
      "growth promoters from all broiler diets. This will ensure sustainable growth and gain consumer\n",
      "acceptance. Broiler feed should receive particular attention by providing the particle size, protein and\n",

      "5.6. Water Quality and Sanitation\n",
      "A good water sanitation program is key to healthy poultry production. Water is essential for birds. A routine water quality analysis for bacteria, pH, hardness, minerals, and total dissolved solids should\n",
      "be conducted annually. Flushing and disinfecting between ﬂocks with suitable quality disinfectants\n",
      "should be done to remove bioﬁlm from the pipeline. Bioﬁlm is a sticky ﬁlm that can exist inside\n",
      "water lines, regulators, and nipple drinkers and can be composed of bacteria and other organisms [66]. Chlorine is the most popular sanitizer; other well-documented sanitizers include hydrogen peroxide,\n",
      "chlorine dioxide, and ozone. In addition, acidiﬁers can improve the sanitizer’s eﬀectiveness and reduce\n",
      "bacterial growth in water lines [67].\n",
      "809\n",
      "5.7. Antibiotic Alternatives\n",
      "Over the past two decades, producers have extensively used antibiotics for broiler weight\n",
      "gain. Including antibiotics in broiler production enhances the food conversion ratio by 4% [68]. Thus, measures need to be in place to oﬀset this loss and any undesirable growth performance\n",
      "in immunocompromised broilers [68]. Additionally, withdrawing antibiotic feed additives could\n",
      "raise necrotic enteritis in the ﬂocks. Although removing antibiotic feed additives from the diet\n",
      "would enhance the production cost, this increased cost can be recovered from the expected increase\n",
      "in broiler meat prices [69]. It should be noted that the eﬀect on broiler growth and weight\n",
      "from the withdrawal of growth-promoting medicines may occur only after the ﬁrst year [70]. Thus, the campaign for an alternative to antibiotics should focus on antimicrobial stewardship [71]. These alternatives should provide a low mortality rate and an adequate level of yield while preserving\n",
      "the environment and consumer health. Much research has been conducted to explore natural agents\n",
      "with beneﬁcial eﬀects similar to growth-promoting antibiotics. In addition, several nontherapeutic\n",

      "Probiotics and Prebiotics\n",
      "Probiotics are yeasts and live bacteria that confer beneﬁcial eﬀects on the health if administered in\n",
      "adequate doses (WHO, 2001). Probiotics can replace antibiotics by changing the intestinal microbiome,\n",
      "thereby producing some of the eﬀects of antibiotics. For example, feed supplementation with probiotics\n",
      "improves the feed eﬃciency and intestinal health and, ultimately, facilitates the faster growth of\n",
      "broilers by reducing the intestinal pH, altering the intestinal bacterial composition, and improving\n",
      "digestive activity [72,73]. Probiotics stimulate endogenous enzyme production, which reduces the\n",
      "production of toxic substances and increases vitamins and/or antimicrobials such as bacteriocins [74]. It has been reported that bacteriocins inhibit the production of toxins and the adhesion of pathogenic\n",
      "microbes [75]. Probiotics decrease colonization by intestinal bacteria and, ultimately, stimulate the\n",
      "immune response [74]. The administration of Enterococcus faecium, Streptomyces spp., and Bacillus spp. in chicken feed triggers antibacterial eﬀects on other pathogenic bacteria in the small intestine\n",
      "(Figure 2) [76–78]. Broiler feed supplemented with B. subtilis increased the body weights by 4.4% [78]. The H2S and NH3 concentrations in chicken excretions were also reduced after treating chickens\n",
      "with probiotics, leading to less odor. Probiotics increased the meat quality of poultry by aﬀecting the\n",
      "fat and protein contents [74,79]. They are essential in improving the water-holding capacity, color,\n",
      "pH, oxidation stability, and the chemical composition of meat, such as the fatty acid content [79]. Feed supplemented with B. licheniformis improves the juiciness, ﬂavor, and color of broiler chicken\n",
      "meat [80], which is appreciated by consumers [81]. Probiotic supplementation also lessens parasitic\n",

      "short-chain polysaccharides [82]. Their fermentable properties stimulate the growth and activity of\n",
      "beneﬁcial bacteria in the ileum and cecum and contribute to a healthy intestinal tract and, ultimately,\n",
      "increase poultry productivity [83,84]. They are also considered as excellent alternatives to antibiotics. Prebiotics alter cecal proteobacteria composition and increase broiler growth [85]. Products containing\n",

      "antibiotics by reducing harmful pathogenic bacteria and increasing potentially beneﬁcial bacteria [87]. 5.7.2. Organic Acids\n",
      "Organic acids are conservation agents widely known for protecting feed from microbial spoilage\n",
      "and improving the nutrient digestibility in poultry [88]. Organic acids include carboxylic acids\n",
      "that carry a hydroxyl group on the alpha-carbon, such as malic, lactic, and tartaric acids, and pure\n",
      "monocarboxylic acids, including acetic, formic, butyric, and propionic acids. Organic acids can inhibit\n",
      "the microbial growth by disrupting bacterial enzymatic reactions and decreasing the transport of acidic\n",
      "compounds by nonionic diﬀusion through the membrane [89]. It has been reported that adding organic\n",
      "acids to feed may improve the growth, feed conversion rate, and feed utilization of broilers [90–92]. While drinking water is a risk factor for spreading campylobacter infection in broilers, Chaveerach et al. demonstrated that organic acid-treated drinking water can potentially prevent campylobacter infection\n",
      "in broiler ﬂocks without any damage to gut epithelial cells [93]. Blends of formic and propionic acids\n",
      "in drinking water for chickens can generate homogeneous and distinct populations in the intestinal\n",
      "microbiota and increase Lactobacillus spp. colonization in the ileum [91], which can be a substitute\n",
      "for antibiotics used to reduce pathogenic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These changes\n",
      "in the intestinal microbiota and increased Lactobacillus populations suggest that organic acids can\n",
      "substitute for antibiotics such as bacitracin to reduce pathogenic bacteria in the GIT [91]. Additionally,\n",
      "organic acids have the potential to inhibit E. coli infection [94], and a supplementation with 2% citric\n",
      "acid can improve the gut health [95]. It has been reported that formic acid, an extensively studied\n",

      "13 of 24\n",
      "organic acid, can limit Salmonella infection and other foodborne pathogens when used in a poultry\n",
      "diet [96]. Several organic acids may also play beneﬁcial roles in digestion. For example, when butyric\n",
      "acid is used as a feed additive, it improves the digestibility of ileal proteins from poorly digestible\n",
      "protein sources [92]. Butyric acid, a saturated carboxylic acid, is produced in the cecum and colon by\n",
      "fermenting carbohydrates such as dietary ﬁber and unabsorbed starch [97]. Moreover, butyric acid is a\n",
      "readily available energy source for intestinal epithelial cells and stimulates their multiplication and\n",
      "diﬀerentiation, thereby improving the feed eﬃciency and growth performance of chickens [82,92,98]. 5.7.3. Amino Acids and Enzymes\n",
      "Broiler feeds are supplemented with amino acids and enzymes to increase the feed conversion [81]. These enzymes are produced by fermenting fungi and bacteria. Enzymes enhance the digestibility\n",
      "of the feed by facilitating the degradation of proteins, phytates, and glucan. For example, it has\n",
      "been reported that broiler diets of wheat and barley supplemented with endo-b-1-4-xylanases and\n",
      "b-1-3, 1-4-glucanases can improve the digestibility of the feed [99]. Another study reported that\n",
      "a phytase enzyme improved daily weight gain by increasing the villus width and decreasing the\n",
      "crypt depth [95]. Lysins are bacteriophage endolysins that could be an alternative therapeutic\n",
      "option instead of antibiotics. Lysins are phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases that cause lysis of\n",
      "bacteria by cleaving peptidoglycan when applied exogenously to Gram-positive bacteria [100,101]. The antibacterial eﬃcacy of several lysins has been reported; for example, peptidases, amidases,\n",
      "and lysozymes showed antimicrobial potential against C. perfringens in poultry [102].\n",
      "1830\n",
      "5.7.4. Phytogenic Feed Additives\n",
      "Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs), also known as phytobiotics or botanicals, are derived from\n",
      "plants, herbs, and spices and can improve animal health. PFAs are reported to positively aﬀect growth\n",
      "by improving the feed conversion ratio (FCR), boosting the immune system, and reducing stress. Several recent studies also showed that phytogenic feed additives promoted broiler chicken growth\n",
      "and could be used as an alternative to antibiotics [72,103–106]. Another study demonstrated that\n",
      "including Lippia javanica in broiler feed at 5 g/kg enhanced the broilers’ daily gain and slaughter weight. Phytogenic extracts of Lippia javanica leaf can stimulate glycolysis and increase energy production\n",
      "utilization and, thus, growth [107]. They can also improve the fatty acid proﬁle of broiler chicken\n",
      "meat [107]. It has been reported that the use of garlic (5 g/kg) and black pepper powder (1 g/kg) in broiler\n",
      "feed could enhance broiler chickens’ weight gain and consumption index [108]. Thus, PFAs have the\n",
      "potential to replace antibiotics in the poultry industry. On the other hand, there are also essential oils,\n",
      "the hydrophobic concentrated liquid of odoriferous and volatile aromatic compounds, which can be of\n",
      "plant origin (natural) or synthetic. The crucial vital oils in broiler production are trans-cinnamaldehyde,\n",
      "thymol, eugenol, and carvacrol. They interfere with the bacterial enzymatic system and modulate\n",
      "inﬂammation and immune responses. They are excellent alternatives to growth-promoting antibiotics\n",
      "such as Avilamycin for increasing chicken production [109–111]. Essential oils also have a signiﬁcant\n",
      "role in preventing and controlling necrotic enteritis in chickens [112]. Furthermore, it was reported that\n",
      "supplementing with essential oils such as oregano (Origanum genus) in broiler feed at 300–600 g/kg\n",
      "increased the average daily gain of broiler chickens [110]. Therefore, essential oils should be used as an\n",
      "alternative to antibiotics in the poultry industry.\n",
      "2009\n",
      "5.7.5. Nanoparticles as Feed Additives\n",
      "Nanoparticles (NPs) used as supplements in broiler chicken feed are favorable for optimizing\n",
      "the overall health and FCR. Some NPs have been used in poultry feed to decrease harmful bacteria\n",
      "and stimulate beneﬁcial bacteria in the chicken microbiota [113]. The impact of NPs on birds has been\n",
      "studied worldwide to better understand the overall health and growth performance, immune response,\n",
      "and antibacterial prospects [114]. Gangadoo et al. [114] noted that the most commonly used silver\n",
      "nanoparticles in commercial chicken feed were shown to boost chickens’ microbiota. However,\n",
      "619\n",
      "Biology 2020, 9, 0411\n",
      "14 of 24\n",
      "silver nanoparticles seem to have a somewhat elevated toxicity in birds. To avoid the toxic side eﬀects,\n",
      "scientists have investigated other nanoparticles that can safely contribute to the positive impact on\n",
      "health and productivity. A study showed that selenium NPs at concentrations ranging from 0.15 to\n",
      "1.20 ppm could enhance broilers’ average daily gains [115]. Others showed that selenium NPs had a\n",
      "positive inﬂuence on chicken bodies, with reduced toxicity achieved at low concentrations from 0.3 to\n",
      "0.5 ppm [116–120]. Meanwhile, similar concentrations of copper NPs as a supplement in poultry feed\n",
      "could have positive or negative health consequences. For example, a concentration of 50 ppm of copper\n",
      "at sizes 2–15 nm produced a decreased metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, and heat production\n",
      "and resulted in reduced embryonic development [121], whereas others showed that including copper\n",
      "NPs in poultry feed could boost breast and leg muscle growth, along with decreased mortality in\n",
      "broiler chicks [121]. Various other metals have been synthesized as NPs as supplements to poultry\n",
      "feed. For example, studies using metal NPs such as zinc oxide, zirconium dioxide, and platinum\n",
      "showed that they had a positive inﬂuence on the antibacterial activity against Salmonella spp. and\n",
      "Staphylococcus aureus [122–124]. On the other hand, Zn-bearing zeolite clinoptilolite NPs were shown\n",
      "to improve broilers’ growth and feed intake ratio [125]. In addition, NPs combined with extracts of\n",
      "natural antibacterial products, such as certain herbs and oils, could be utilized to upgrade the overall\n",
